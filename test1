'''The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is like that of the planter — for the future. His duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come, and point the way.'''

Dr. Nikola Tesla Looks Forward to the Era When '''One Titanic Electrical Wireless Station Shall Supply Power for the World''' — Tells of Other Developments That '''We Have Good Reason to Expect.’’’

'''Mr. Tesla's visions suggested hashish to some rock ribbed scientists, but in 1915 [he definitely claimed to have, or at the least he coherced reporter(s), several times, over many years, into printing that] he got the Nobel physics prize [lmao] for his research in energy transmission, his take-off in today's prophecy. While he has called many of the modern scientific miracles in advance, some are still in suspense, notably his prediction that some day the Atlantic Ocean will be lit up like Forty-second street and Broadway by some comparatively simple, electrical conjuring.'''

'''Imagine a thermopile consisting of a number of bars of metal extending from the earth to the outer space beyond the atmosphere.’’’

'''The two terminals of the thermopile could now be joined through an electric motor, and, theoretically, this motor would run on and on, until the media below would be cooled down to the temperature of the outer space.'''

'''Experts have jumped to the conclusion that I am attempting to realize a perpetual-motion scheme. But my process has been carefully worked out. It is rational.'''

'''But was it not possible to realize a similar condition without necessarily going to a height?’’’

'''Corresponding to this ideal case, all the water flowing into the tank would be decomposed into oxygen and hi rogan before reaching the bottom, and the result would be that water would continually flow in, and yet the tank would remain entirely empty, the gases formed escaping.

We would thus produce, by expending initially a certain amount of work to create a sink for the heat or, respectively, the water to flow in, a condition enablinus to get any amount of energy without further effort.'''

'''Thus the virtue of the principle I have discovered resides wholly in the conversion of the energy on the downward flow.'''

'''Tesla contradicts a part of the relativity theory emphatically, holding that mass is unalterable; OTHERWISE, energy could be produced from nothing, since the kinetic energy acquired in the fall of a body would be greater than that necessary to lift it at a small velocity.’’’

'''But as to atomic energy, my experimental observations have shown that the process of disintegration is not accompanied by a liberation of such energy as might be expected from the present theories.’’’

Experiments conducted by Mr. Nikola Tesla with electromotive forces of 2,000,000 volts have convinced him that if 100,000,000 volts could be produced it might be possible to break down the atomic structure of any element and thus liberate a certain amount of energy. '''BUT,''' he told the writer of this article, '''even if the feat could be accomplished and sufficient energy set free, there still remains the enormously difficult problem of devising a means of utilizing the energy in a practical way.’’’

'''If we were to release the energy of atoms or discover some other way of developing cheap and unlimited power at any point of the globe this accomplishment, instead of being a blessing, might bring disaster to mankind in giving rise to dissension and anarchy which would ultimately result in the enthronement of the hated regime of force.’’’

'''War can not be avoided until the physical cause for its recurrence is removed and this, in the last analysis, is the vast extent of the planet on which we live. Only thru annihilation of distance in every respect, as the conveyance of intelligence, transport of passengers and supplies and transmission of energy will conditions be brought about some day, insuring permanency of friendly relations. What we now want most is closer contact and better understanding between individuals and communities all over the earth, and the elimination of that fanatic devotion to exalted ideals of national egoism and pride which is always prone to plunge the world into primeval barbarism and strife. No league or parliamentary act of any kind will ever prevent such a calamity. These are only new devices for putting the weak at the mercy of the strong.'''

'Vast Energy Freed by Uranium Atom Split, It Produces 2 `Cannon balls', Each of 100,000,000 Electron Volts'

'POFESSOR EINSTEIN had never expected he would write such a letter. Apart from the fact that he was an avowed pacifist, he did not believe that the atom's energy would be released. Even after the neutron had been discovered in 1932 (it proved to be the magic bullet in atom‐smashing) he had declared: “There is not the slightest indication that energy will ever be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will.” '

'Pro. Albert Einstein, the German astronomer and author of the theory of "Relativity" that is apparently upsetting all accepted doctrines, believes that Mars and other planets are inhabited but if intelligent creatures are trying to communicate with the earth he should expect them to use rays of light, which would much more easily be controlled.'

'''Observation will bring out the fact that the weakening is not noticeable until the aerials have reached a position, with reference to the sun, in which the evaporation of the water is distinctly more rapid. The maximum will not be exactly when the angle of incidence of the suns rays is greatest, but some time after.

It is noteworthy that the experimenters who watched the effect of the recent eclipse, above referred to, have observed the delay.’’’

'''I am positive in my conviction that we can erect a plant of proper design in an arid region, work it according to certain observations and rules, and by its means draw from the ocean unlimited amounts of water for irrigation and power purposes.  If I do not live to carry it out, somebody else will, but I feel sure that I am right.’’’

'''I was born exactly at midnight, I have no birthday and I never celebrate it.'''

'''Persons arranging for the presentation ceremony were a little doubtful for a time whether it should be held today or yesterday, as the inventor has sometime jokingly told his friends that since he was born on the stroke of midnight he didn't know which day was his birthday.''' 

'''Another addition to the birthday anniversary message of the famous inventor was a positive declaration that he expected soon to construct apparatus that would disprove the theories of modern astronomers that the sun gradually was cooling off and eventually the earth would be unable to sustain life, as it would grow too cold.

He pointed out that his theory means a future for the earth as different from the general belief as the future of the sun. It is generally held that life on the earth will cease when the sun grows so cold that the earth temperature drops to a point where life can no longer be supported.

Dr. Tesla prophesies that life on the earth will cease because the planet will grow too warm to support life, and he believes that life will then begin on outer planets now too cold.

He said that his discovery not only allowed him to predict a very different future for the heavenly bodies from that now generally expected for them, but also to calculate in a new way their age.

As an hors d'oeuvre to this Jules Vernean announcement, Dr. Tesla disclosed that he has lately perfected instruments which flatly disprove the present theory of the high physicists that the sun is destined to burn itself out until it is a cold cinder floating in space.

Dr. Tesla stated that he is able to show that all the suns in the universe are constantly growing in mass and heat, so that the ultimate fate of each is explosion.’’’

'''Brethren! We have a message from another world, unknown and remote. It reads: 1—2—3’’’

'''In time, however, I recognized that devices of this kind, to be most effective and efficient, should be designed with due regard to the physical properties of this planet and the electrical conditions obtaining on the same.'''

Apart from love and religion there happened the other day to Mr. Tesla the most momentous experience that has ever visited a human being on this earth.

As he sat beside his instrument on the hillside in Colorado, in the deep silence of that austere, inspiring region, where you plant your feel in gold and your head brushes the constellations — as he sat there one evening, alone, his attention, exquisitively alive at that juncture, was arrested by a faint sound from the receiver — three fairy taps, one after the other, at a fixed ('''The most essential requirement is, however, that irrespective of frequency the wave or wave-train should continue for a certain interval of time, which I have estimated to be not less than [~]one-twelfth or probably 0.08484 [2121/25000th] of a second and which is taken in passing to and returning from the region diametrically opposite the pole over the earth’s surface with a mean velocity of about four hundred and seventy-one thousand two hundred and forty kilometers per second.’’’) interval.

What man who has ever lived on this earth would not envy Tesla that moment! [Lee de Forest: [Father of wireless #1,000] "If I could be any other man I would be Nikola Tesla."] Never before since the globe first swung into form had that sound been heard. Those three soft impulses, reflected from the sensitive disc of the receiver, had not proceeded from any earthly source.

The force which propelled them, the measure which regarded them, the significance they were meant to convey, had their origin in no mind native to this planet.

They were sent, those marvelous signals, by a human being living and thinking so far away from us, both in space and in condition, that we can only accept him as a fact, not comprehend him as a phenomenon.

Traveling with the speed of light, they must have been dispatched but a few moments before Tesla, in Colorado, received them. But they came from some Tesla on the planet Mars!

'''I caught signals which I interpreted as meaning 1—2—3—4. I believe the Martians used numbers for communication because numbers are universal.'''

'''Fig 8. This Diagram Illustrates How, During a Solar Eclipse, the Moon's Shadow Passes Over the Earth With Changing Velocity, and Should Be Studied In Connection With Fig. 9. The Shadow Moves Downward With Infinite Velocity at First. Then With Its True Velocity Thru Space, and Finally With Infinite Velocity Again.

Consider now the process taking place in the transmission by the instrumentalities and methods of my invention.

'''The mode of propagation of the currents from my transmitter through the terrestrial globe is most extraordinary considering the spread of the electrification of the surface. The wave starts with a theoretically infinite speed, slowing down first very quickly and afterward at a lesser rate until the distance is about six thousand miles, when it proceeds with the speed of light. From there on it again increases in speed, slowly at first, and then more rapidly, reaching the antipode with approximately infinite velocity. The law of motion can be expressed by stating that the waves on the terrestrial surface sweep in equal intervals of time over equal areas, but it must be understood that the current penetrates deep into the earth and the effects produced on the receivers are the same as if the whole flow was confined to the earth’s axis joining the transmitter with the antipode.’’’

'''Assuming that the moon does physically rotate upon its axis, it performs one revolution in 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes and 11 seconds, or 2,360,591 seconds. If, in conformity with mathematical principles, we imagine the entire mass concentrated at a distance from the center equal to two-fifths of the radius, then the calculated rotational velocity is 3.04 feet per second, at which the globe would contain 11,474,000,000,000,000,000 short foot tons of energy sufficient to run 1,000,000,000 horsepower for a period of 1,323 years. Now, I say, that there is not enough of that energy in the moon to run a delicate watch.'''

'''The unfailing test of the spinning of a mass is, however, the existence of energy of motion. The moon is not possest of such vis viva.'''

'''In astronomical treatisies usually the argument is advanced that “if the lunar globe did not turn upon its axis it would expose all parts to terrestrial view. As only a little over one-half is visible it must rotate.” But this inference is erroneous, for it only admits of one alternative. There are an infinite number of axis besides its own in each of which the moon might turn and still exhibit the same peculiarity.'''

'''The earth and moon [actually] revolve around a common center of gravity, which is, at a distance of a little over [on average] 2,899 miles from the earth’s center.'''

'''If the gravitational string, as it were, would snap, the satellite would go off in a tangent without the slightest swerving or rotation, for there is no moment about the axis and, consequently, no tendency whatever to spinning motion.'''

‘’’In Fig. 7 in which the [separated] two masses [of the moon], condensed into points, are represented as attached to independent weightless strings of lengths Rg1 and Rg2 which are purposely shown as displaced but should be imagined as coincident.

It will be readily seen that if BOTH strings are cut in the same instant the masses will fly off in tangents to their circular orbits, the angular movement becoming rectilinear without any transformation of energy occurring. 

Let us now inquire what will happen if the two masses are rigidly joined, the connection being assumed imponderable.

Here we come to the REAL BUG  in the question under discussion..’’’

'''It will be difficult for most people engaged in practical pursuits to measure or even to form an adequate conception of the intensity of inspiration and force I derive from that part of my work which has passed into history. I have every reason to consider myself one of the most fortunate men, for I experience incessantly a feeling of inexpressible satisfaction that my alternating system is universally employed in the transmission and distribution of heat, light and power and that also my wireless system, in all its essential features, is used throughout the world for conveying intelligence. But my pioneer efforts in this later field are still grossly misunderstood.'''

'''Modern systems of power transmission will become antiquated. Compact relay stations one half or one quarter the size of our modern power plants will be the basis of operation—in the air and under the sea, for [sea] water will effect small loss in conveying energy by wireless.’’’

'''By proper design and choice of wave lengths, you can arrange it so that you get, for instance, 5 percent in these electromagnetic waves and 95 percent in the current that goes through the earth. That is what I am doing. Or you can get, as these radio men, 95 percent in the energy of electromagnetic waves and only 5 percent in the energy of the current. The apparatus is suitable for one or the other method. I am not producing radiation with my system; I am suppressing electromagnetic waves. In my system, you should free yourself of the idea that there is radiation, that the energy is radiated. It is not radiated; it is conserved.’’’

'''One of the most important uses of wireless energy will be undoubtedly for the propulsion of flying machines to which power can be readily supplied without ground connection, for altho the flow of the currents is confined to the earth an electro magnetic field is created in the atmosphere surrounding it.

If conductors or circuits accurately attuned and properly positioned are carried by the plane, energy is drawn into these circuits much the same as a fluid will pass through a hole created in the container. With an industrial plant of great capacity sufficient power can be derived in this manner to propel any kind of aerial machine.’’’

'''It is perfectly practicable to transmit electrical energy without wires and produce destructive effects at a distance. I have already constructed a wireless transmitter which makes this possible, and have described it in my technical publications, among which I may refer to my patent 1,119,732 recently granted. With transmitters of this kind we are enabled to project electrical energy in any amount to any distance and apply it for innumerable purposes, both in peace and war.

Through the universal adoption of this system, ideal conditions for the maintenance of law and order will be realized, for then the energy necessary to the enforcement of right and justice will be normally productive, yet potential, and in any moment available, for attack and defense.

The power transmitted need not be necessarily destructive, for, if existence is made to depend upon it, its withdrawal or supply will bring about the same results as those now accomplished by force of arms.’’’

'''As this wireless energy is converted into a commodity for the use of the masses, transport and transmission will be subjected to tremendous changes.  Content will be flashed across limitless spaces by my system. The same energy will drive airplanes and dirigibles from one central base.’’’

'''Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment and merging of races, and we are still far from this blissful realization.'''

"Now comes the '''dream''' — or whatever it is. Tesla says he can split the earth in the same way — split it as a boy would split an apple — and forever end the career of man.'''

'''There is no doubt in my mind. The earth would be split in two. For the first time in man's history, he has the knowledge with which he may interfere with cosmic processes.'''


'''Early in 1884, while employed by a French Company in Paris, I made important improvements in dynamos and motors and was engaged by the Edison interests in New York to design and construct similar machines for them.

It had been the height of my ambition and my most ardent wish to come in contact with Edison and see America.

Accordingly, I undertook the voyage and after

(At that moment I discovered that my money and tickets were gone. What to do was the question.)

losing my money and tickets and passing through a series of mishaps

(Hercules had plenty of time to deliberate but I had to decide while running alongside the train with opposite feelings surging in my brain like condenser oscillations.),

including a mutiny in which I nearly lost my life,

(Resolve, helped by dexterity, won out in the nick of time and upon passing thru the usual experiences, as trivial as unpleasant,

I managed to embark for New York with the remnants of my belongings,

some poems and articles I had written,



and a package of calculations relating to solutions of an unsolvable integral and to my flying machine.



During the voyage I sat most of the time at the stern of the ship watching for an opportunity to save somebody from a watery grave, without the slightest thought of danger.

Later when I had absorbed some of the practical American sense I shivered at the recollection and marvelled at my former folly.)

I landed on these blessed shores with four cents in my pocket.

My first intention was to look up a close American friend before going to the Edison establishment.[?]

On my way uptown I came to a small machine shop in which the foreman was trying to repair an electric machine of European make.

He had just given up the task as hopeless and I undertook to put it in order



without a thought of compensation.



It was not easy but I finally had it in perfect running condition.



I was astonished 



('''It was a machine I had helped to design, but I did not tell them that. I asked, '''What is the matter?''' and they said, 'This thing won’t work.' I asked, '''what would you give me if I fix it?''' ‘Twenty dollars’ was the reply. I took off my coat and went to work. I had it running perfectly in an hour and had earned $20.''')



when he gave me twenty dollars and wished that I had come to America years before.



The next day I was thrilled to the marrow by meeting Edison who began my American education right then and there.

I wanted to have my shoes shined, something I considered below my dignity.

Edison said: "Tesla, you will shine the shoes yourself and like it."

He impressed me tremendously. I shined my shoes and liked it.'''

'''Within a few weeks I had won Edison's confidence and it came about in this way.

The S.S. Oregon, the fastest p̷a̷s̷s̷e̷n̷g̷e̷r̷ [navy] steamer at that time, had both of its lighting machines disabled and its sailing was delayed.

As the superstructure had been built after their installation it was impossible to remove them from the hold.

The predicament was a serious one and Edison was much annoyed.

In the evening I took the necessary instruments with me and went aboard the vessel where I stayed for the night. The dynamos were in bad condition, having several short-circuits and breaks, but with the assistance of the crew I succeeded in putting them in good shape.

At five o'clock in the morning, when passing along Fifth Avenue on my way to the shop, I met Edison with Batchellor and a few others as they were returning home to retire.

"Here is our Parisian running around at night," he said. When I told him that I was coming from the Oregon and had repaired both machines, he looked at me in silence and walked away without another word.

But when he had gone some distance I heard him remark: "Batchellor, this is a d—n good man," and from that time on I had full freedom in directing the work.

For nearly a year my regular hours were from 10.30 A.M. until 5 o'clock the next morning without a day's exception.

(All this time I was getting more and more anxious about the [induction motor] invention and was making up my mind to place it before Edison. I still remember an odd incident in this connection. One day in the latter part of 1884 Mr. Bachelor, the manager of the works, took me to Coney Island, where we met Edison in company with his former wife. The moment that I was waiting for was propitious, I was just about to speak when a horrible looking tramp took hold of Edison and drew him away, preventing me from carrying out my intention.)

Edison said to me: "I have had many hard-working assistants but you take the cake." During this period I designed twenty-four different types of standard machines with short cores and of uniform pattern which replaced the old ones.

The Manager had promised me fifty thousand dollars on the completion of this task



but it turned out to be a practical joke.





This gave me a painful shock and I resigned my position.'''


(He shortly found it was not all so easy as that. There were many days when he did not know where the next meal was coming from. '''But I was never afraid to work. I went to where some men were digging a ditch. I said I wanted to work. The boss looked at my good clothes and white hands and he laughed to the others. ‘This man wants to work.’ But he said ‘All right. Spit on your hands. Get in the ditch. Go to work.’ And I worked harder than anybody. At the end of that day I had $2. And I kept it up until I had enough to get started again.''')


    Sometime in 1888:
Nikola Tesla sells the rights to his Alternating Current power distribution system patents to Westinghouse for a
$60,000 ($1,943,930.53 '23) lump sum,
a $2,000 ($64,797.68 '23) monthly salary
and a $2.50 ($81.00 '23) per horsepower transmitted royalty.
(~$462 billion annually in the USA '23)

'''If Edison had a needle to find in a haystack, he would proceed at once with the diligence of the bee to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search... I was a sorry witness of such doings, knowing that a little theory and calculation would have saved him ninety per cent of his labor.'''

'''The recurrence of a phenomenon like Edison is not very likely. The profound change of conditions and the ever increasing necessity of theoretical training would seem to make it impossible. He will occupy a unique and exalted position in the history of his native land, which might well be proud of his great genius and undying achievements in the interest of humanity.'''

'''Think of it, a great mechanical eye, created of finest tempered steel, endowed with electric power and seeing to all parts of the earth''' "Science, in the person of Nikola Tesla announces it as a realized achievement. It affords a fantastic picture, a superb imaginative flight for the mechanical 💊rb will follow in principle the exquisite and flawless construction of the human eye.

Tesla, the creator,
is a Nobel prize winner 😆 and the man who harnessed Niagara Falls. He describes his all-seeing eye as follows:"

'''Suffice to say that the destructive invention will go through space with a speed of 300 miles a second, a manless airship without pr💊pelling engine or wings, sent by electricity to any desired point on the globe on their errands of destruction, if destruction their deep state remote operator wishes to effect.'''

'''It is not the time,''' said Dr. Tesla yesterday, '''to go into the details of this thing. It is founded on a principle that means great things in peace; it can be used for great things in war.


But I repeat,


this is no time to talk of such things.'''

'''Since prohibition was enacted I have not touched a drop, and long before that I gave up all other stimulants. I gave up alcohol, in spite of the fact that it was beneficial to me, in obedience to the law, and I find that I cannot now return to it. I had previously expected to live 160 years. Now that I have given up alcohol, I have reduced my expectancy of life to 135 years.’’’

'''My peace beam projects particles which may be relatively (It is important to devise a thoroughly practical and simple means for supplying particles and I have invented two which seem to meet this requirement.) large or of microscopic dimensions'''

'''I think that as much as one-billionth of a micron can be attained. What may be accomplished by means of such vacua is a matter of conjecture, but it is obvious that they will make possible the production of much more intense effects in electron tubes.

My ideas regarding the electron are at variance with those generally entertained.

I hold that it is a relatively large body carrying a surface charge and not an elementary unit.

When such an electron leaves an electrode of extremely high potential and in very high vacuum, it carries an electrostatic charge many times greater than the normal.

This may astonish some of those who think that the particle has the same charge in the tube and outside of it in the air.'''

'''In my attempts with an effective 20 million volts, electrons carried 40 times more electricity than normally and penetrated two meters in depth and terrible damage in a moment each. I have to finish because that I give you a fresh view.'''

'''A different kind of energy than is commonly employed must be used, however, he said, explaining further that '''you must realize it travels through a channel of less than one-half of one-millionth of a centimeter.'''

'''There will not be any light, electrical energy will deliver particles through space with the speed of 118,837,370,000 centimeters per second.'''

'''This is 3.94579 the speed of light.'''

'''Particles are practical with neutrons, because, they are 3.723 times lighter than electricity or electrons that cannot penetrate space for great distances.'''

'''The point of energy could be aimed at the moon and ‘‘‘we very easily could see the effects, see the splash and the volatilization of matter.’’’ He also pictured the possibility of advanced thinkers living on other planets and also experimenting in this field, but mistaking the Tesla energy rays for some form of cosmic rays.

'''In rocket-propelled machines… it will be practicable to attain [hypersonic] speeds of nearly 1️ [weeeaaaakkkk] mile a second (3600 m.p.h.) through the rarefied medium above the stratosphere'''

'''I do not say that there may not be several destructive wars before the world accepts my gift. I may not live to see its acceptance. But I am convinced that a century from now every nation will render itself immune from attack by my device or by a device based upon a similar principle.'''

'''In addition to the value of this engine for destruction in time of war, Dr. Tesla said it could be utilized in peace for the transmission of power. He had not developed ideas for receiving apparatus capable of transforming the destructive beam into work units, but considered this merely a matter of detail. 

No suggestion was made of what might happen if an enemy power obtained possession of one of these receiving outfits, and when attacked by the destructive beam simply put the received energy to work in factories manufacturing munitions or uniforms.'''

'''Television, as conceived by me in 1893, will be another valuable and timely application. At that time I advanced the idea that the formation of a clear mental image of external objects is accompanied by a reflex action on the retina, making it possible to read thoughts and even to project the images conceived on a screen and render them visible to an audience. This would be of inestimable consequence on all human relations but the idea can not be realized until some way is found to lay bare the retina. Continued reflections on this subject led me to evolve apparatus for transmitting instantaneously true vision without any moving devices, and in 1900 I had already solved three of the problems which confronted me, namely: to individualize and isolate a very great number of channels or '''nerves'''; to convey to the receiving apparatus energy in sufficient amount, and, to make the vision of the moving images independent of distance.'''

'''The idea is that all concepts, in the last analysis, are visual and are photographed on the retina while the thought is held. No one could lie or deceive if this invention came into use.'''

'''Unfortunately, it is true, that cunning lawbreakers will avail themselves of such advantages to further their nefarious business.'''

'''This discovery of mine will be remembered when everything else I have done, is covered with dust.'''

"This text has been entered by John R.H. Penner from a small booklet found in a used bookstore for $2.5 
It seems that some of the sentences, appearing in The Strange Life of Nikola Tesla, have been left out from My Inventions IIIIII. And vice versa, some of the sentences have been added to My Inventions VI"

Early one morning he called his favorite messenger boy, Kerrigan, gave him a sealed envelope, and ordered him to deliver it as quickly as possible. It was addressed to "Mr. Samuel Clemens, 35 South Fifth Ave., New York City."

Kerrigan returned in a short time with the statement that he could not deliver the message because the address was incorrect. There is no such street as South Fifth Ave., the boy reported; and in the neighborhood of that number on Fifth Ave. no one by the name of Clemens could be located.

Tesla became annoyed. He told Kerrigan: '''Mr. Clemens is a very famous author who writes under the name Mark Twain, and you should have no trouble locating him at the address I gave you. He lives there.'''

Kerrigan reported to the manager of his office and told him of his difficulty. The manager told him: "Of course you couldn't find South Fifth Avenue. Its name was changed to West Broadway years ago, and you won't be able to deliver a message to Mark Twain because he has been dead for twenty-five years."

Kerrigan returned to his office. The envelope, not too well sealed, was opened in the hope it would give some clue as to how the message could be delivered, The envelope contained a blank sheet of paper wrapped around
— twenty $5 bills! —
When Kerrigan tried to return the money, Tesla told him,
— with great annoyance, —
either to deliver the money or keep it.



    Sometime around the 1907 financial panic:
Nikola Tesla "tears up" his $ 2.5 per horsepower royalty contract with Westinghouse and receives instead a one time payment of $ 216,000 ($7,072,598.30 '23).

'''This is a transmission of energy exactly as I illustrated in my experimental lectures in which one end of a wire is connected to an electric generator of high potential, its other end being free. In this case the generator is represented by the sun and the wire by the conducting air.

'''The passage of the solar current involves the transference of electric charges from particle to particle with the speed of light, thus resulting in the production of extremely short and penetrating waves.’’’

'''the display of high potential must occur on the free end of the terrestrial wire, that is to say, on the side turned away from the sun. The current from the latter is supplied at a pressure of about 216 billion volts and there is a difference of 2 billion volts between the illuminated and the dark side of the globe. The energy of this current is so great that it readily accounts for the aurora and other phenomena observed in the atmosphere and at the earth's surface.’’’

'''The kinetic and potential energy of a body is the result of motion and determined by the product of its mass and the square of velocity. Let the mass be reduced, the energy is diminished in the same proportion. If it be reduced to zero the energy is likewise zero for any finite velocity. In other words, it is absolutely impossible to convert mass into energy. IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF there were forces in nature capable of imparting to a mass infinite velocity. THEN the product of zero mass with the square of infinite velocity would represent infinite energy.’’’

'''For the time being I must content myself with the announcement of the salient facts, but in due course I expect to be able to give more or less accurate technical data relating to all particulars of this discovery.’’’



'''No matter where I was, that pigeon would find me; when I wanted her I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. She understood me and I understood her.'''

'''I loved that pigeon.'''

'''Then one night as I was lying in my bed in the dark, solving problems, as usual, she flew in through the open window and stood on my desk. I knew she wanted me; she wanted to tell me something important so I got up and went to her. As I looked at her I knew she wanted to tell me—she was dying. And then, as I got her message, there came a light from her eyes—powerful beams of light.'''

'''This would be of inestimable consequence on all human relations but the idea can not be realized until some way is found to lay bare the retina. Continued reflections on this subject led me to evolve apparatus for transmitting instantaneously true vision without any moving devices, and in 1900 I had already solved three of the problems which confronted me, namely: to individualize and isolate a very great number of channels or “nerves”; to convey to the receiving apparatus energy in sufficient amount, and, to make the vision of the moving images independent of distance. Eventually also I hope to overcome the shortcomings of the solar panel by a different device.'''

'''Yes,''' he continued, again answering an unasked question, '''it was a real light, a powerful, dazzling, blinding light, a light more intense than I had ever produced by the most powerful lamps in my laboratory.'''


'''I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them, for years; thousands of them, for who can tell — '''


"It was a homing pigeon with a leg band reading: “I. F. 34 N. U. 1286,” and it seemed to have just got in after a long hard flight. It was caught and shut in a bathroom until its legband could be deciphered."

"After looking over the bird, Dr. Tesla decided that it wasn’t sick but hungry and a little upset by having gorged itself, for want of anything more edible, on snow. He decided to keep it anyway."


"The archive of Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade keeps about 2500 her letters and different papers she wrote to him very often, almost every day. She exchanged letters with Tesla between 1891 and 1942"

"she had very unreadable handwriting"

"There are no copies of his letters to her"


"You know, it’s a very good thing that the Institute is honoring Tesla in this way—it will go a long way toward diminishing his reputation for voyeurism which was embarrassing to the older members. The stories of Tesla’s sexual episodes were at one time the talk of the Institute, and we didn’t know how to deal with it if the matter should somehow become publicized. You must be aware, of course, that he never went out with women. . . . Anyway, the older members of the Institute are dying off so those stories will also die out eventually"



'''The year 2100 will see
'''Progress along such lines will be impossible while nations persist in the savage practice of killing each other off



"Nikola Tesla, approaching his 84th birthday, has been spending almost all of his time in his apartment, so much of it, in fact, that he has had to hire messenger boys to go into the parks to feed the pigeons. Tesla, the fabulous electrical wizard, used to feed the pigeons religiously himself, but age and mysterious experiments with sound waves purportedly for the army have combined to confine him to his rooms."
 
 
"Dr. Nikola Tesla, inventor, will be 85 years old today. However, at his room in the Hotel New Yorker he said yesterday he had decided to postpone the celebration—and the interview  that  traditionally accompanied it — until

'''later''' "


'''As though I am poor with words.'''


'''Nikola Tesla, Stop in New York but heart is at Niagara.'''

                             '''𝗗𝗬𝗡𝗔𝗠𝗢 𝗘𝗟𝗘𝗖𝗧𝗥𝗜𝗖 𝗠𝗔𝗖𝗛𝗜𝗡𝗘𝗦—𝘕. 𝘛𝘦𝘴𝘭𝘢, 𝘙𝘢𝘩𝘸𝘢𝘺, 𝘕𝘦𝘸 𝘑𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘦𝘺,
                             𝘜.𝘚.𝘈.—The object of this invention is to provide an improved
                             method for regulating the current of dynamo electric machines.
                             A¹ and B¹ are the brushes of the main circuit, and C an auxiliary
                             brush.  The working circuits D extends from the brushes A¹ and
                             B¹, and contains electric lamps in series or in multiple arc.
                             M M¹ represent the field helices, the ends of which are con-
                             nected to the main brushes.  The shunt wire C¹ extends from
                             the auxiliary brush C to the intermediate point X in the circuit
                             of the field helices.  H represents the commutator with the
                             plates of ordinary construction.  A current will flow over the
                             auxiliary brush, to or from the commutator, according to the
                             relative position of the brushes.  If, for instance, the commutator


                             space between the brushes A¹ and C, when the latter is at the
                             neutral point, is diminished, a current will flow from the point
                             Y over the shunt C¹ to the brush B¹, thus strengthening the
                             current in the part M¹, and partly neutralising[sic] the current in
                             the part M; but if the space between the brushes A¹ and
                             C is increased, the current will flow over the auxiliary
                             brush in an opposite direction, and the current in M will be
                             strengthened, and in M¹ partly neutralised[sic].  By combining with
                             the brushes A¹ B¹ and C any known automatic regulating
                             mechanism, the current developed can be regulated in pro-
                             portion to the demands in the working circuit.  The respective
                             cores of the field magnet are subjected to the neutralising[sic] or
                             intensifying effects of the current in the shunt through C¹, and
                             the magnetism of the cores will be partially neutralised[sic] or the
                             point of greatest magnetism shifted, so that it will be more
                             or less remote from, or approaching to, the armature, and
                             hence the action of the field magnets on the armature will be
                             correspondingly varied.  Claims: (1) The combination with the
                             commutator, having two or more main brushes and an auxiliary
                             brush, of the field helices, having their ends connected to the
                             main brushes, and a branch or shunt connection from an inter-
                             mediate point of the field helices to the auxiliary brush, and
                             means for varying the relative position upon the commutator
                             of the respective brushes, as set forth; (2) the combination with
                             the commutator and the main brushes, and one or more auxiliary
                             brushes, of the field helices in the main circuits, and one or more
                             shunt connections from the field helices to the auxiliary brushes,
                             the relative positions upon the commutator of the respective brushes,
                             being adjustable for the purpose set forth.—No. 2975.

                           May 16th, 1888

'''I desire to express my thanks to Professor Anthony for the help he has given me in this matter. I would also like to express my thanks to Mr. Pope and Mr. Martin for their aid. The notice was rather short, and I have not been able to treat the subject so extensively as I could have desired, my health not being in the best condition at present. I ask your kind indulgence, and I shall be very much gratified if the little I have done meets your approval.

In the presence of the existing diversity of opinion regarding the relative merits of the alternate and continuous current systems, great importance is attached to the question whether alternate currents can be successfully utilized in the operation of motors. The transformers, with their numerous advantages, have afforded us a relatively perfect system of distribution, and although, as in all branches of the art, many improvements are desirable, comparatively little remains to be done in this direction. The transmission of power, on the contrary, has been almost entirely confined to the use of continuous currents, and notwithstanding that many efforts have been made to utilize alternate currents for this purpose, they have, up to the present, at least as far as known, failed to give the result desired. Of the various motors adapted to be used, on alternate current circuits the following have been mentioned:

1. A series motor with subdivided field.
2. An alternate current generator having its field excited by continuous currents.
3. Elihu Thomson's motor.
4. A combined alternate and continuous current motor.

Two more motors of this kind have suggested themselves to me.

1. A motor with one of its circuits in series with a transformer and the other in the secondary of the transformer.
2. A motor having its armature circuit connected to the generator and the field coils closed upon themselves.

These, however, I mention only incidentally.

The subject which I now have the pleasure of bringing to your notice is a novel system of electric distribution and transmission of power by means of alternate currents, affording peculiar advantages, particularly in the way of motors, which I am confident will at once establish the superior adaptability of these currents to the transmission of power and will show that many results heretofore unattainable can be reached by their use; results which are very much desired in the practical operation of such systems and which cannot be accomplished by means of continuous currents.

Before going into a detailed description of this system, I think it necessary to make a few remarks with reference to certain conditions existing in continuous current generators and motors, which, although generally known, are frequently disregarded.


In our dynamo machines, it is well known, we generate alternate currents which we direct by means of a commutator, a complicated device and, it may be justly said, the source of most of the troubles experienced in the operation of the machines. Now, the currents so directed cannot be utilized in the motor, but they must — again by means of a similar unreliable device — be reconverted into their original state of alternate currents. The function of the commutator is entirely external, and in no way dues it affect the internal working of the machines. In reality, therefore, all machines ace alternate current machines, the currents appearing as continuous only in the external circuit during their transit from generator to motor. In view simply of this fact, alternate currents would commend themselves as a more direct application of electrical energy, and the employment of continuous currents would only be justified if we had dynamos which would primarily generate, and motors which would be directly actuated by such currents.


Fig. 1
Fig. 1a

But the operation of the commutator on a motor is twofold; firstly, it reverses the currents through the motor, and secondly, it effects, automatically, a progressive shifting of the poles of one of its magnetic constituents. Assuming, therefore, that both of the useless operations in the system, that is to say, the directing of the alternate currents on the generator and reversing the direct currents on the motor, be eliminated, it would still be necessary, in order to cause a rotation of the motor, to produce a progressive shifting of the poles of one of its elements, and the question presented itself, — How to perform this operation by the direct action of alternate currents? I will now proceed to show how this result was accomplished.

Fig. 2
Fig. 2a

In the first experiment a drum-armature was provided with two coils at right angles to each other, and the ends of these coils were connected to two pairs of insulated contact-rings as usual. A ring was then made of thin insulated plates of sheet-iron and wound with four coils, each two opposite coils being connected together so as to produce free poles on diametrically opposite sides of the ring. The remaining free ends of the coils were then connected to the contact-rings of the generator armature so as to form two independent circuits, as indicated in figure 9. It may now be seen what results were secured in this combination, and with this view I would refer to the diagrams, figures 1 to 8a. The field of the generator being independently excited, the rotation of, the armature sets up currents in the coils C C, varying in strength and direction in the well-known manner. In the position shown in figure 1 the current in coil C is nil while coil C1 is traversed by its maximum current, and the connections my be such that the ring is magnetized by the coils c1 c1 as indicated by the letters N S in figure 1a, the magnetizing effect of the coils c c being nil, since these coils are included in the circuit of coil C.

In figure 2 the armature coils are shown in a more advanced position, one-eighth of one revolution being completed. Figure 2a illustrates the corresponding magnetic condition of the ring. At this moment the coil cl generates a current of the same direction as previously, but weaker, producing the poles n1 s1 upon the ring; the coil c also generates a current of the same direction, and the connections may be such that the coils c c produce the poles n s, as shown in figure 2a. The resulting polarity is indicated by the letters N S, and it will be observed that the poles of the ring have been shifted one-eighth of the periphery of the same.

Fig. 3
Fig. 3a

In figure 3 the armature has completed one-quarter of one revolution. In this phase the current in coil C is maximum, and of such direction as to produce the poles N S in figure 3a, whereas the current in coil C1 is nil, this coil being at its neutral position. The poles N S in figure 3a are thus shifted one-quarter of the circumference of the ring.

Figure 4 shows the coils C C in a still more advanced position, the armature having completed three-eighths of one revolution. At that moment the coil C still generates a current of the same direction as before, but of less strength, producing the comparatively weaker poles n sin figure 4a. The current in the coil C1 is of the same strength, but of opposite direction. Its effect is, therefore, to produce upon the ring the poles n1 and s1 as indicated, and a polarity, N S, results, the poles now being shifted three-eighths of the periphery of the ring.

Fig. 4
Fig. 4a

In figure 5 one-half of one revolution of the armature is completed, and the resulting magnetic condition of the ring is indicated in figure 5a. Now, the current in coil C is nil, while the coil C1 yields its maximum current, which is of the same direction as previously; the magnetizing effect is, therefore, due to the coils c1 c1 alone, and, referring to figure 5a, it will be observed that the poles N S are shifted one-half of the circumference of the ring. During the next half revolution the operations are repeated, as represented in the figures 6 to 8a.

A reference to the diagrams will make it clear that during one revolution of the armature the poles of the ring are shifted once around its periphery, and each revolution producing like effects, a rapid whirling of the poles in harmony with the rotation of the armature is the result. If the connections of either one of the circuits in the ring are reversed, the shifting of the poles is made to progress in the opposite direction, but the operation is identically the same. Instead of using four wires, with like result, three wires may be used, one forming a common return for both circuits.

Fig. 5
Fig. 5a

This rotation or whirling of the poles manifests itself in a series of curious phenomena. If a delicately pivoted disc of steel or other magnetic metal is approached to the ring it is set in rapid rotation, the direction of rotation varying with the position of the disc. For instance, noting the direction outside of the ring it will be found that inside the ring it turns in an opposite direction, while it is unaffected if placed in a position symmetrical to the ring. This is easily explained. Each time that a pole approaches it induces an opposite pole in the nearest point on the disc, and an attraction is produced upon that point; owing to this, as the pole is shifted further away from the disc a tangential pull is exerted upon the same, and the action being constantly repeated, a more or less rapid rotation of the disc is the result. As the pull is exerted mainly upon that part which is nearest to the ring, the rotation outside and inside, or right and left, respectively, is in opposite directions, figure 9. When placed symmetrically to the ring, the pull on opposite sides of the disc being equal, no rotation results. The action is based on the magnetic inertia of the iron; for this reason a disc of hard steel is much more affected than a disc of soft iron, the latter being capable of very rapid variations of magnetism. Such a disc has proved to be a very useful instrument in all these investigations, as it has enabled me to detect any irregularity in the action. A curious effect is also produced upon iron filings. By placing some upon a paper and holding them externally quite close to the ring they are set in a vibrating motion, remaining in the same place, although the paper may be moved back and forth; but in lifting the paper to a certain height which seems to be dependent on the intensity of the poles and the speed of rotation, they are thrown away in a direction always opposite to the supposed movement of the poles. If a paper with filings is put flat upon the ring and the current turned on suddenly, the existence of a magnetic whirl may be easily observed.

Fig. 6
Fig. 6a

To demonstrate the complete analogy between the ring and a revolving magnet, a strongly energized electro-magnet was rotated by mechanical power, and phenomena identical in every particular to those mentioned above were observed.

Obviously, the rotation of the poles produces corresponding inductive effects and may be utilized to generate currents in a closed conductor placed within the influence of the poles. For this purpose it is convenient to wind a ring with two sets of superimposed coils forming respectively the primary and secondary circuits, as shown in figure 10. In order to secure the most economical results the magnetic circuit should be completely closed, and with this object in view the construction may be modified at will.

Fig. 7
Fig. 7a

The inductive effect exerted upon the secondary coils will be mainly due to the shifting or movement of the magnetic action; but there may also be currents set up in the circuits in consequence of the variations in the intensity of the poles. However, by properly designing the generator and determining the magnetizing effect of the primary calls the latter element may be made to disappear. The intensity of the poles being maintained constant, the action of the apparatus will be perfect, and the same result will be secured as though the shifting were effected by means of a commutator with an infinite number of bars. In such case the theoretical relation between the energizing effect of each set of primary coils and their resultant magnetizing effect may be expressed by the equation of a circle having its centre coinciding with that of an orthogonal system of axes, and in which the radius represents the resultant and the co-ordinates both of its components. These are then respectively the sine and cosine of the angle a between the radius and one of the axes (O X). Referring to figure 1 I, we have r2= x2 + y2; where x = r cos a, and y = r sin a.

Fig. 8
Fig. 8a

Assuming the magnetizing effect of each set of coils in the transformer to be proportional to the current — which may be admitted for weak degrees of magnetization — then x = Kc and y = Kc1, where K is a constant and c and c1 the current in both sets of coils respectively. Supposing, further, the field of the generator to be uniform, we have for constant speed c1 = K1 sin a and c = K1 sin (90° + a) = K1 cos a, where K1 is a constant. See figure 12.

Therefore, x = Kc = K K1 cos a;

y = Kc1= K K1 sin a, and

K K1 = r.

That is, for a uniform field the disposition of the two coils at right angles will secure the theoretical result, and the intensity of the shifting poles will be constant. But from r2 = x2 + y2 it follows that for y = 0, r = x; it follows that the joint magnetizing effect of both sets of coils should be equal to the effect of one set when at its maximum action. In transformers and in a certain class of motors the fluctuation of the poles is not of great importance, but in another class of these motors it is desirable to obtain the theoretical result.

In applying this principle to the construction of motors, two typical forms of motor have been developed. First, a form having a comparatively small rotary effort at the start, but maintaining a perfectly uniform speed at all loads, which motor has been termed synchronous. Second, a form possessing a great rotary effort at the start, the speed being dependent on the load.

Fig. 9

These motors may be operated in three different ways:

1. By the alternate currents of the source only.
2. By a combined action of these and of induced currents.
3. By the joint action of alternate and continuous currents.

The simplest form of a synchronous motor is obtained by winding a laminated ring provided with pole projections with four coils, and connecting the same in the manner before indicated. An iron disc having a segment cut away on each side may be used as an armature. Such a motor is shown in figure 9. The disc being arranged to rotate freely within the ring in close proximity to the projections, it is evident that as the poles are shifted it will, owing to its tendency to place itself in such a position as to embrace the greatest number of the lines of force, closely follow the movement of the poles, and its motion will be synchronous with that of the armature of the generator; that is, in the peculiar disposition shown in figure 9, in which the armature produces by one revolution two current impulses in each of the circuits. It is evident that if, by one revolution of the armature, a greater number of impulses is produced, the speed of the motor will be correspondingly increased. Considering that the attraction exerted upon the disc is greatest when the same is in close proximity to the poles, it follows that such a motor will maintain exactly the same speed at all loads within the limits of its capacity.

Fig. 10

To facilitate the starting, the disc may be provided with a coil closed upon itself. The advantage secured by such a coil is evident. On the start the currents set up in the coil strongly energize the disc and increase the attraction exerted upon the same by the ring, and currents being generated in the coil as long as the speed of the armature is inferior to that of the poles, considerable work may be performed by such a motor even if the speed be below normal. The intensity of the poles being constant, no currents will be generated in the coil when the motor is turning at its normal speed.

Instead of closing the coil upon itself, its ends may be connected to two insulated sliding rings, and a continuous current supplied to these from a suitable generator. The proper way to start such a motor is to close the coil upon itself until the normal speed is reached, or nearly so, and then turn on the continuous current. If the disc be very strongly energized by a continuous current the motor may not be able to start, but if it be weakly energized, or generally so that the magnetizing effect of the ring is preponderating it will start and reach the normal speed. Such a motor will maintain absolutely the same speed at all loads. It has also been found that if the motive power of the generator is not excessive, by checking the motor the speed of the generator is diminished in synchronism with that of the motor. It is characteristic of this form of motor that it cannot be reversed by reversing the continuous current through the coil.

Fig. 11
Fig. 12

The synchronism of these motors may be demonstrated experimentally in a variety of ways. For this purpose it is best to employ a motor' consisting of a stationary field magnet and an armature arranged to rotate within the same, as indicated in figure 13. In this case the shifting of the poles of the armature produces a rotation of the latter in the opposite direction. It results therefrom that when the normal speed is reached, the poles of the armature assume fixed positions relatively to the field magnet and the same is magnetized by induction, exhibiting a distinct pole on each of the pole-pieces. If a piece of soft iron is approached to the field magnet it will at the start be attracted with a rapid vibrating motion produced by the reversals of polarity of the' magnet, but as the speed of the armature increases, the vibrations become less and less frequent and finally entirely cease. Then the iron is weakly but permanently attracted, showing that the synchronism is reached and the field magnet energized by induction.

The disc may also be used for the experiment. If held quite close to the armature it will turn as long as the speed of rotation of the poles exceeds that of the armature; but when the normal speed is reached, or very nearly so, it ceases to rotate and is permanently attracted.

A crude but illustrative experiment is made with an incandescent lamp. Placing the lamp in circuit with the continuous current generator, and in series with the magnet coil, rapid fluctuations are observed in the light in consequence of the induced currents set up in the coil at the start; the speed increasing, the fluctuations occur at longer intervals, until they entirely disappear, showing that the motor has attained its normal speed.

A telephone receiver affords a most sensitive instrument; when connected to any circuit in the motor the synchronism may be easily detected on the disappearance of the induced currents.

In motors of the synchronous type it is desirable to maintain the quantity of the shifting magnetism constant, especially if the magnets are not properly subdivided.

To obtain a rotary effort in these motors was the subject of long thought. In order to secure this result it was necessary to make such a disposition that while the poles of one element of the motor are shifted by the alternate currents of the source, the poles produced upon the other element should always be maintained in the proper relation to the former, irrespective of the speed of the motor. Such a condition exists in a continuous current motor; but in a synchronous motor, such as described, this condition is fulfilled only when the speed is normal.

Fig. 13

The object has been attained by placing within the ring a properly subdivided cylindrical iron core wound with several independent coils closed upon themselves. Two coils at right angles as in figure 14, are sufficient, but a greater number may be advantageously employed. It results from this disposition that when the poles of the ring are shifted, currents are generated in the closed armature coils. These currents are the most intense at or near the points of the greatest density of the lines of force, and their effect is to produce poles upon the armature at right angles to those of the ring, at least theoretically so; and since action is entirely independent of the speed — that is, as far as the location of the poles is concerned — a continuous pull is exerted upon the periphery of the armature. In many respects these motors are similar to the continuous current motors. If load is put on, the speed, and also the resistance of the motor, is diminished and more current is made to pass through the energizing coils, thus increasing the effort. Upon the load being taken off, the counter-electromotive force increases and less current passes through the primary or energizing coils. Without any load the speed is very nearly equal to that of the shifting poles of the field magnet.

It will be found that the rotary effort in these motors fully equals that of the continuous current motors. The effort seems to be greatest when both armature and field magnet are without any projections; but as in such dispositions the field cannot be very concentrated, probably the best results will be obtained by leaving pole projections on one of the elements only. Generally, it may be stated that the projections diminish the torque and produce a tendency to synchronism.

A characteristic feature of motors of this kind is their capacity of being very rapidly reversed. This follows from the peculiar action of the motor. Suppose the armature to be rotating and the direction of rotation of the poles to be reversed. The apparatus then represents a dynamo machine, the power to drive this machine being the momentum stored up in the armature and its speed being the sum of the speeds of the armature and the poles. If we now consider that the power to drive such a dynamo would be very nearly proportional to the third power of the speed, for this reason alone the armature should be quickly reversed. But simultaneously with the reversal another element is brought into action, namely, as the movement of the poles with respect to the armature is reversed, the motor acts like a transformer in which the resistance of the secondary circuit would be abnormally diminished by producing in this circuit an additional electromotive force. Owing to these causes the reversal is instantaneous.

If it is desirable to secure a constant speed, and at the same time a certain effort at the start, this result may be easily attained in a variety of ways. For instance, two armatures, one for torque and the other for synchronism, may be fastened on the same shaft, ,and any desired preponderance may be given to either one, or an armature may be wound for rotary effort, but a more or less pronounced tendency to synchronism may be given to it by properly constructing the iron core; and in many other ways.

Fig. 14

As a means of obtaining the required phase of the currents in both the circuits, the disposition of the two coils at right angles is the simplest, securing the most uniform action; but the phase may be obtained in many, other ways, varying with the machine employed. Any of the dynamos at present in use may be easily adapted for this purpose by making connections to proper points of the generating coils. In closed circuit armatures, such as used in the continuous current systems, it is best to make four derivations from equi-distant points or bars of the commutator, and to connect the same to four insulated sliding rings on the shaft. In this case each of the motor circuits is connected to two diametrically opposite bars of the commutator. In such a disposition the motor may also be operated at half the potential and on the three-wire plan, by connecting the motor circuits in the proper order to three of the contact rings.

Fig. 15
Fig. 16
Fig. 17

In multipolar dynamo machines, such as used in the converter systems, the phase is conveniently obtained by winding upon the armature two series of coils in such a manner that while the coils of one set or series are at their maximum production of current; the coils of the other will be at their neutral position, or nearly so, whereby both sets of coils may be subjected simultaneously or successively to the inducing action of the field magnets.

Generally the circuits in the motor will be similarly disposed, and various arrangements may be made to fulfill the requirements; but the simplest and most practicable is to arrange primary circuits on stationary parts of the motor, thereby obviating, at least in certain forms, the employment of sliding contacts. In such a case the magnet coils are connected alternately in both the circuits; that is 1, 3, 5 …. in one, and 2, 4, 6 …. in the other, and the coils of each set of series may be connected all in the same manner, or alternately in opposition; in the latter case a motor with half the number of poles will result, and its action will be correspondingly modified. The figures 15, 16 and 17, show three different phases, the magnet coils in each circuit being connected alternately in opposition. In this case there will be always four poles, as in figures 15 and 17, four pole projections will be neutral, and in figure 16 too adjacent pole projections will have the same polarity. If the coils are connected in the same manner there will be eight alternating poles, as indicated by the letters n's' in fig. 15.

The employment of multipolar motors secures in this system an advantage much desired and unattainable in the continuous current system, and that is, that a motor may be made to run exactly at a predetermined speed irrespective of imperfections in construction, of the load, and, within certain limits, of electromotive force and current strength.

In a general distribution system of this kind the following plan should be adopted. At the central station of supply a generator should be provided having a considerable number of poles. The motors operated from this generator should be of the synchronous type, but possessing sufficient rotary effort to insure their starting. With the observance of proper rules of construction it may be admitted that the speed of each motor will be in some inverse proportion to its size, and the number of poles should be chosen accordingly. Still exceptional demands may modify this rule. In view of this, it will be advantageous to provide each motor with a greater number of pole projections or coils, the number being preferably a multiple of two and three. By this means, by simply changing the connections of the coils, the motor may be adapted to any probable demands.

Fig. 18
Fig. 19
Fig. 20
Fig. 21


If the number of the poles in the motor is even, the action will be harmonious and the proper result will be obtained; if this is not the case the best plan to be followed is to make a motor with a double number of poles, and connect the same in the manner before indicated, so that half the number of poles result. 

Suppose, for instance, that the generator has twelve poles, and it would be desired to obtain a speed equal to 12/7 of the speed of the generator. This would require a motor with seven pole projections or magnets, and such a motor could not be properly connected in the circuits unless fourteen armature coils would be provided, which would necessitate the employment or sliding contacts. To avoid this the motor should be provided with fourteen magnets and seven connected in each circuit, the magnets in each circuit alternating among themselves:

The armature should have fourteen closed coils. The action of the motor will not be quite as perfect as in the case of an even number of poles, but the drawback will not be of a serious nature.

However, the disadvantages resulting from this unsymmetrical form will be reduced in the same proportion as the number of the poles is augmented.

If the generator has, say, n, and the motor n1 poles, the speed of the motor will be equal to that of the generator multiplied by n/n1.


The speed of the motor will generally be dependent on the number of the poles, but there may be exceptions to this rule. The speed may be modified by the phase of the currents in the circuits or by the character of the current impulses or by intervals between each or between groups of impulses. Some of the possible cases are indicated in the diagrams, figures 18, 19, 20 and 21 which are self-explanatory. Figure 18 represents the condition generally existing, and which secures the best result. In such a case, if the typical form of motor illustrated in figure 9 is employed, one complete wave in each circuit will produce one revolution of the motor. In figure 19 the same result will be effected by one wave in each circuit, the impulses being successive; in figure 20 by four, and in figure 21 by eight waves.

By such means any desired speed may be attained; that is, at least within the limits of practical demands. This system possesses this advantage besides others, resulting from simplicity. At full loads the motors show an efficiency fully equal to that of the continuous current motors. The transformers present an additional advantage in their capability of operating motors. They are capable of similar modifications in construction, and will facilitate the introduction of motors and their adaptation to practical demands, Their efficiency should be higher than that of the present transformers, and I base my assertion on the following:

In a transformer as constructed at present we produce the currents in the secondary circuit by varying the strength of the primary or exciting currents. If we admit proportionality with respect to the iron core the inductive effect exerted upon the secondary coil will be proportional to the numerical sum of the variations in the strength of the exciting current per unit of time; whence it follows that for a given variation any prolongation of the primary current will result in a proportional loss. In order to obtain rapid variations in the strength of the current, essential to efficient induction, a great number of undulations are employed. From this practice various disadvantages result. These are, increased cost and diminished efficiency of the generator, more waste of energy in heating the cores, and also diminished output of the transformer, since the core is not properly utilized, the reversals being too rapid. The inductive effect is also very small in certain phases, as will be apparent from a graphic representation, and there may be periods of inaction, if there are intervals between the succeeding current impulses or waves. In producing a shifting of the poles in the transformer, and thereby inducing currents, the induction is of the ideal character, being always maintained at its maximum action. It is also reasonable to assume that by a shifting of the poles less energy will be wasted than by reversals.'''

*** DISCUSSION ***
Mr. Martin: "Professor Anthony, I believe, is here, and as he has given this subject some attention, I think he might very properly supplement Mr. Testa's paper by some remarks."

Mr. Tesla: '''I want to express once more my best thanks to Professor Anthony for aiding me in many respects, and I hope he will be able to explain many of the features in this system that I was unable to explain at present.'''

Professor Anthony: "Mr. President and Gentlemen: I have been referred to as having had something to do with these forms of motors. I am very glad to be able to add my testimony to what Mr. Tesla has already given you in regard to their action, and I confess that on first seeing the motors the action seemed to me an exceedingly remarkable one. After my first visit to Mr. Tesla's works, some of the motors; I think these very two that you see here on the table, were brought to me to make some tests of their efficiency, and probably you will be more interested in those than in anything else that I might say. I am sorry I have not brought with me the exact figures that we obtained, but I can give you from memory something of the result. This little motor that you see here gave us about half a horse-power, and gave an efficiency of something above fifty per cent., which I considered a very fair efficiency for a motor of this size, as we cannot expect on such small motors to get as high efficiency as we can on larger ones. This, I believe, is the armature that Mr. Tesla calls the armature for high rotary effort. This little pulley, which is only about three inches in diameter, gave a pull of something like fifty pounds, as I remember it on turning on the current, so that you see the rotary effort is very considerable, and that is also shown in the quickness with which the armature will reverse its motion on reversing the relation of the two currents which pass through the two opposite coils. That could be done by shifting two of the wires, or simply shifting a reversing key in one of the circuits, and the armature would stop and reverse its motion so quickly that it was almost impossible to tell when the change took place. That shows also the very considerable rotary effort that the armature presents. This motor (referring to the second specimen) gave us, I think, about 1 1/4 h.p., and showed a somewhat higher efficiency than the other — a little over sixty per cent. This would run, with the armature as here constructed, almost at the speed of the generator even under a very heavy load. When the load was brought up to the maximum load, where the efficiency began to fall off somewhat, the speed of rotation was reduced. As I remember now, it was reduced to about twenty-eight hundred, and the speed, you see, kept up very nearly to that of the generator under heavy load.

I can add very little to what Mr. Tesla has already given you in regard to these motors. I have no question but that all of you would be as much interested as I was in seeing them work, that is really the best way in which to determine what the motors will do."

Mr. Tesla: '''Mr. President and Gentlemen: Professor Anthony just made the remark that the speed of this motor fell off when the load was increased. That was due to the fact that this armature was designed to secure a strong effort from the start. But if we make an armature which is only designed for synchronism, the speed will always be the same no matter what the load; only there is a disadvantage that at the start the rotary force is so small that it is apt not to start. It would generally start if put in a proper position, but if not put in a proper position it might not start. If we employ an armature consisting of a cut-away block of steel with a coil, it will maintain its speed at all loads. The importance of maintaining the intensity of the pole constant is that if this can be produced we can utilize, instead of the subdivided armature, an ordinary steel block with the same result. It is only desired to close the magnetic field. You can readily see, if the poles are fixed, that it is not necessary to subdivide the armature, if the intensity of the force is constantly maintained the same. But, if the intensity is not maintained the same, then it is necessary to subdivide, and generally in the results that I have obtained I have found that it is necessary to subdivide. I have also observed that in the tests of Professor Anthony the results obtained were superior. I attribute that to the fact that the dynamo has got a powerful field and a small armature and the field is very concentrated; and for that reason probably, the result is nearer a theoretical result.'''

Professor Thomson: "I have been very much interested in the description given by Mr. Tesla of his new and admirable little motor. I have, as probably you may be aware, worked in somewhat similar directions, and towards the attainment of similar ends. The trials which I have made have been by the use of a single alternating current circuit — not a double alternating circuit — a single circuit supplying a motor constructed to utilize the alternation and produce rotation. I have carried on since the last annual meeting of the Institute the development and perfecting, as far as my time allowed, of a closed circuited armature — if we may so term it — related to the alternating field. That is, the plan which I used and which I brought to the notice of the Institute last year, was to make a laminated field and do that field to place an armature also laminated, winding upon the armature a coil which periodically is close circuited during the revolution by a suitable commutator or circuit-closing device. I have made several such motors on different designs and they uniformly start from a state of rest and develop power, and some of them show, at speeds close to the rate of alternations of the dynamo, a tendency to synchronize. Their rotary effort in most cases is a little greater nearer that point than at other points. I hope: sometime before a great while to bring most of these results before the notice of the Institute, and I would therefore prefer delaying further remarks on motors of this description. I certainly think there is a field for alternating motors, and there is undoubtedly an opportunity for obtaining motors which possess even some advantages over the continuous current motors."

Mr. Tesla: '''Gentlemen, I wish to say that the testimony of such a man as Professor Thomson, as being foremost in his profession, flatters me very much. I might say that I have worked in the same line with Professor Thomson at a period when the invention of Professor Thomson was not known to me. I had a motor identically the same as that of Professor Thomson but I was anticipated by him. I believe that although that peculiar form of motor represents the disadvantage that a pair of brushes must be employed to short circuit the armature coil, that such a form of motor may be made practicable for the simple reason that a motor represents a transformer, and such a transformer we well know we can bring to a very high efficiency. On the other hand, the armature may be provided with conductors that are of comparatively low resistance, and it is a mere matter of making a perfect arrangement for short circuiting. You will see the advantage of this disposition of the closed circuit coil — that this action is always maintained at the maximum and it is indeed more perfect than if the polarities were shifted by means of a commutator.'''

                              PROFESSOR  GALILEO  FERRARIS, of  Turin,  who as will
                              be remembered,  was  one  of  the  first  to  make  a strictly
                              scientific investigation  of transformers, and  who  has since
                              then continued to devote attention to alternating currents,
                              has just published the results of some experiments made
                              with  a  view  to  produce  continuous  rotation   by  their
                              means.    The   experiments  are interesting,  because  the
                              apparatus used was based upon an entirely new principle,
                              which  may  be  capable  of  further  development.    The
                              question  how  to  produce  continuous rotation  by means
                              of  alternating current is  just  now  occupying  the minds
                              of  many electricians, because the production of an alter-
                              nating current motor would greatly increase the earning
                              capacity of central electric  light stations supplying alter-
                              nating  currents.    Whether  the  apparatus  devised  by
                              Professor  Ferraris,  and  which we are about  to  describe,
                              will lead to the discovery of an alternating current motor,
                              is a  question  on which  we  do  not  pretend  to prophesy ;
                              but  as  the  principle  involved  may  also  have  other
                              applications,  notably  in  the  construction  of  meters  for
                              measuring  the  supply  of  electricity,   we  think  it  of
                              sufficient  importance  to  lay  a  short  abstract  of  the
                              investigation before our readers.   The principle on which
                              the apparatus  is  based  is  exceedingly simple, and will be
                              understood  by  reference  to  the  accompanying  sketches.
                              Let in Fig. 1 the lines  O A  and  O B  represent in direction
                              and magnitude the strength of the two magnetic fields.  The
                              combined  actions  of  these  fields on a unit pole, placed in
                              the point O, would  then  be represented by the resultant
                              O R.   Instead  of  having two distinct fields, we have one
                              resultant field,  represented  in  direction  and  magnitude
                              by  this  line.   If  both  fields  undergo  periodic  variations
                              of  the  same   period,  the   resultant  field  O R  will   also
                              undergo a periodic variation, and the point R will traverse
                              a curve, the  form  of   which   depends   upon   the   precise
                              manner in which the lines  O A  and  O B  change with the
                              time.   The fields  O A  and  O B  can  be  produced by two
                              coils,  having  the  lines  O X  and  O Y  respectively  for
                              their  axes,  and  which  coils  are  traversed  by  alternating
                              currents of the same period.  If  the  alternating  currents
                              may be expressed as sine functions of the time, and if there
                              is an appreciable lag between the currents in the two coils,
                              the  point  R  describes and  ellipse  round  O  as  centre.   In


                              this  case  the  line  O R  representing  the  resultant  field
                              revolves around the centre O, the direction and magnitude
                              of  the  resultant  field  changing  at  every  instant.    If,
                              however,  there  is  no  lag  between the  two currents, that
                              is to  say, if  they  pass  through  zero  simultaneously,  the
                              direction  of  the  resultant  field  O R  remains  stationary,
                              and the point  R  performs  harmonic  oscillation  over  the
                              line  R O  and  its  prolongation  with  O  as centre.    This
                              may be considered as a special case of the ellipse where
                              the  latter  has  been  flattened  down  to  a  mathematical
                              line.   Another special case occurs when the ellipse becomes
                              a  circle, and this must evidently take place when the lag
                              between  the  two  currents  is 90°,  when  the  coils  are  at
                              right angles to each  other, and when the component fields
                              are  equally  strong.    A  metallic  body  suspended  in  the
                              centre  of  the  two  fields,  and  free  to  revolve,  must
                              evidently have a tendency to participate in the rotation
                              of the resultant field.
                                 The  application  of  this  very  simple  principle  will  be
                              clear from Fig, 2, in which the two  coils are indicated by
                              the rectangles  A  and  B, the connections  being made by
                              the  wires  1 1¹  and  2 2¹  respectively.   When alternating
                              currents  are  sent  through  these  coils a resultant field is
                              produced, which  revolves  round  the  line  O O.   In  the
                              centre  between  the  coils  is  suspended  a  small  hollow
                              cylinder  of  copper, and as the lines of the resultant field
                              cut the metal Foucault  currents are induced, and by the
                              interaction  of  these  induced currents and  the  revolving
                              field  the  cylinder  is  set  in  rotation.   The  action  is
                              exactly  the  reverse  of  that  occurring in the well  known
                              experiment  in  which  a  copper  disc  is  rapidly  revolved
                              below a compass needle, with the result that the compass
                              needle is deflected on account of  the  induced currents in
                              the copper disc, and ultimately caused to rotate with the
                              copper disc.
                                 Up  to  the   present  we  have  spoken  of  two  distinct
                              currents being required in the  coils  A  and  B, one lagging
                              behind the other by a  quarter period ; and to perform the
                              experiment  we  might  employ  an  alternating  current
                              dynamo  with  two circuits  in  the armature, so arranged
                              with  regard  to  each  other as to produce the desired lag.
                              It  is,  however,  possible  to  perform  the  experiment  by
                              using and ordinary alternating  current machine with only
                              one circuit  on  the armature, and to  produce the second
                              current  by means of  a  transformer.   The  current  from
                              the  machine  is  sent  through  the primary of  the  trans-
                              former and then through the coils  A, whilst the secondary
                              current  obtained  from the  transformer  is  sent through
                              the coil  B.   It is then possible, by the interposition of a
                              suitable  inert  resistance  into  the  secondary  circuit, to
                              obtain  very  nearly  the  desired  lag  of  90 °  between the
                              currents in the two coils.   As the strength of  the  second-
                              dary  current will, by the  insertion  of  the  resistance, be
                              considerably  reduced, it  is  necessary, in  order to obtain
                              approximately equal fields from the  two coils, to employ
                              a  larger  number  of  turns  in  the  coil  B  than  in  A.
                              Another  method  of  producing  the  desired  result  con-
                              sists  in  using  a  transformer  with  one  primary and two
                              secondary coils, and  to  insert  into  the  circuit  of  one  of
                              the  secondary coils  a  large self  induction, and  into that
                              of the other a large  inert resistance, by  which means the
                              desired lag between the two  secondary currents  can also
                              be obtained,   It will be seen that in either of  these ways
                              it  is  possible, by  means  of  a  simple alternating current
                              and  a  transformer,   the  coils  of  which  are  abreast,  to
                              obtain  a  revolving  magnetic  field  of  approximately
                              uniform  intensity, by which  phenomena can be produced
                              in  every  respect  similar  to  those   obtainable  from  a
                              revolving permanent steel magnet.
                                 In the first experiment  made  by Professor Ferraris, a
                              Gaulard & Gibbs transformer,  with  an  equal  number of
                              turns in  the  primary and secondary coils, was used.   In
                              the primary circuit was included the coils  A, consisting of
                              a few turns of  stout wire, whilst in  the secondary circuit
                              were included and adjustable and non-inductive  resistance
                              and the coil B, the latter consisting of many turns of fine
                              wire.   A small hollow copper cylinder was suspended  on
                              a thread in the centre of the two coils, as shown in Fig. 2.
                              If the current was sent through only one of the coils, the
                              cylinder  remained  at  rest ;  but  if  currents  were  sent
                              through  both  coils, the  cylinder  immediately  started to
                              revolve, twisting  the  thread  on  which it was suspended.
                              A reversing switch was inserted  in  the secondary circuit,
                              and if the current  through  this  circuit was inserted, the
                              cylinder  was  immediately  brought to rest, and started in
                              the  opposite  direction.   Professor  Ferrasis  next  substi-
                              tuted a small iron cylinder for the copper one,  and found
                              equal results ;  but when using an iron cylinder sufficiently
                              large  to  nearly  fill the  place withing  the coils, the experi-
                              ment did not succeed so well.   He attributed this to the
                              greater  self induction  which  the  presence  of  iron  in  a
                              large  mass necessarily  introduced  into  both  circuits.
                              another experiment was made with a small iron cylinder,
                              composed of a number of thin discs insulated  from  each
                              other,  and  this  experiment  also  succeeded.   Foucault
                              currents  could  not  in  this  case be the cause of rotation,
                              and Professor  Ferraris thinks that the rotation is due to
                              hysteresis.   A  larger  apparatus  was  then  constructed,


                              which is indicated in our sketch  Fig. 3.   In this case the
                              copper  cylinder,  which  was  mounted  upon a  horixontal
                              axis  in  bearings, had  a  diameter  of  3½in.,  and was 7in.
                              long,  its  weight  being  11lb.   This cylinder  was  closely
                              surrounded by the primary and secondary coils wound upon
                              wooden  bobbins.   To  make  room  for  the  shaft each coil
                              was in halves, the  primary consisting of  ninety-six  turns
                              of seventy-seven  mils. Wire, both coupled in series, so as to
                              produce the effect of  a  coil  of  192  turns ;  the  secondary
                              consisting  of  504  turns  of  thirty-eight  mils.  Wire,  both
                              being  coupled  in  parallel, so  as  to  produce  the  effect
                              of  504  turns.   The  resistance  of  the  primary  coils
                              was   7∙12   and   6∙3   ohms  respectively,  and  that  of
                              the  two  secondary  coils  coupled  in  parallel  was  3∙43
                              ohms.   In  the  secondary  circuit  was  also  inserted  a
                              rheostat without self induction, and the best results were
                              obtained  when the  rheostat  was  set  to  between  15 and
                              18  ohms.   A  Gaulard  &  Gibbs  transformer  was  used,
                              giving eighty reversals per  second.   The copper cylinder
                              began to revolve when the primary current was 5 ampéres,
                              and  with  higher  currents the  velocity  could  be increased
                              to nine  hundred  revolutions per minute, and  might have
                              been still further increased but for the somewhat imperfect
                              mechanical  arrangements, which  occasioned considerable
                              vibrations.   To  the  shaft  was  applied  a  small  friction
                              dynamometer,  and  the  following  table  gives  the  work
                              obtained on the brake by a primary current of 9 ampéres
                              at different speeds : —

                              Revolutions per minute…. 
                               262     400     546     653     722    770    772     900
                               1∙32    2∙12    2∙65    2∙77    2∙55   2∙40   2∙04      0
                              Watts obtained on brake…

                              The  maximum  energy  was  obtained  at 650 revolutions.
                              Beyond  that  speed  the  energy  decreased, which is attri-
                              buted  by  Professor  Ferraris to the imperfect mechanical
                              arrangement  of  the  apparatus,  causing  a  considerable
                              waste  of power in vibrations.   If it were not for this, the
                              maximum  energy  would  have  been  obtained  at  about
                              1200 revolutions, whilst at 2400 revolutions,  which  is  the
                              speed  of  the  revolving  resultant  field,  no  energy at all
                              could  be obtained.   Professor  Ferarris suggests that this
                              apparatus  may  be  used  for  lecture  purposes,  and  as  a
                              motor when  the power required is small, and it may also
                              be used as and electricity meter.   The torque  exerted  by
                              the revolving field upon the copper cylinder is proportional
                              to  the  square  of the current, and in order that the total
                              number of revolutions performed in a given time may  be
                              and  indication  of  the  number  of coulombs supplied, it is
                              necessary  to  introduce  some opposing force which varies
                              with the square of the velocity.   If this can  be done, and
                              if  the  friction of the journals can be sufficiently reduced,
                              an ordinary counter attached to the  axis  would  indicate
                              the quantity of electricity supplied.

                                    '''To the editor of Electrical Review:

                                        I find in your issue of last week a note of
                                    Mr. Duncan referring to my system of alter-
                                    nate current motors.

                                        As I see that Dr. Duncan has not as yet
                                    been made acquainted with the real character
                                    of my invention, I cannot consider his article
                                    in the light of a serious criticism and would
                                    think it unnecessary to respond; but desiring
                                    to express a my consideration for him and the
                                    importance which I attach to his opinion, I
                                    will point out here briefly the characteristic
                                    features of my invention, inasmuch as they
                                    have a direct bearing on the article above
                                    referred to.
                                        The principle of action of my motor will
                                    be well understood from the following:

                                        By passing alternate currents in proper
                                    manner through independent energizing cir-
                                    cuits in the motor, a progressive shifting or
                                    rotation of the poles of the same is effected.
                                    This shifting is more or less continuous ac-
                                    cording to the construction of the motor and
                                    the character and relative phase of the cur-
                                    rents employed, and I have indicated the
                                    theoretical conditions which should exist in
                                    order to secure the most perfect action.
                                        If a laminated ring be wound with four
                                    coils, and the same be connected in proper
                                    order to two independent circuits of an al-
                                    ternate current generator adapted for this
                                    purpose, the passage of the currents through
                                    the coils produces theoretically a rotation of
                                    the poles of the ring, and in actual practice
                                    in a series of experiments, I have demon-
                                    strated the complete analogy between such
                                    a ring and a revolving magnet. From the
                                    application of this principle to the operation
                                    of motors, two forms of motor of a charac-
                                    ter widely differing have resulted, one de-
                                    signed for constant and the other for vari-
                                    able load. The misunderstanding of Dr.
                                    Duncan is due to the fact that the prominent
                                    features of each of these two forms have not
                                    been specifically stated. In illustration of a
                                    representative of the second class, I refer to
                                    Fig. 1, on page 1 of Electrical Review
                                    of May 12th. In this instance, the arma-
                                    ture of the motor is provided with two coils
                                    at right angles. As it may be believed that
                                    a symmetrical arrangement of the coils with
                                    respect to the poles is required, I will assume
                                    that the armature is provided with a great
                                    number of diametrically wound coils or con-
                                    ductors closed upon themselves, and forming
                                    many independent circuits. Let it now
                                    be supposed that the ring is permanently
                                    magnetized so as to show two poles (N and
                                     S) at two points diametrically opposite, and
                                    that it is rotated by mechanical power. The
                                    armature being stationary, the rotation of
                                    the ring magnet will set up currents in the
                                    closed armature coils. These currents will
                                    be most intense at or near the points of the
                                    greatest density of the force, and they will
                                    produce poles upon the armature core at
                                    right angles to those of the ring. Of course
                                    there will be other elements entering into ac-
                                    tion which will tend to modify this, but for
                                    the present they may be left unconsidered.
                                    As far as the location of the poles upon the
                                    armature core is concerned, the currents gen-
                                    erated in the armature coils will always act
                                    in the same manner, and will maintain con-
                                    tinuously the poles of the core in the same
                                    position, with respect to those of the ring in
                                    any position of the latter, and independently
                                    of the speed. From the attraction between
                                    the core and the ring, a continuous rotary
                                    effort, constant in all positions, will result,
                                    the same as in a continuous current motor
                                    with a great number of armature coils. If
                                    the armature be allowed to turn, it will re-
                                    volve in the direction of rotation of the ring
                                    magnet, the induced current diminishing as
                                    the speed increases, until upon the armature
                                    reaching very nearly the speed of the mag-
                                    net, just enough current will flow through
                                    the coils to keep up the rotation. If, instead
                                    of rotating the ring by mechanical power
                                    the poles of the same are shifted by the ac-
                                    tion of the alternate currents in the two cir-
                                    cuits, the same results are obtained.
                                        Now compare this system with a continu-
                                    ous current system. In the latter we have
                                    alternate currents in the generator and motor
                                    coil, and intervening devices for commu-
                                    tating the currents, which on the motor
                                    besides effect automatically a progressive
                                    shifting or rotation of the poles of the arma-
                                    ture; here we have the same elements and
                                    identically the same operation, but without
                                    the commutating devices. In view of the
                                    fact that these devices are entirely unessen-
                                    tial to the operation, such alternate current
                                    system will—at least in many respects—show
                                    a complete similarity with a continuous cur-
                                    rent system, and the motor will act precisely
                                    like a continuous current motor. If the
                                    load is augmented the speed is diminished
                                    and the rotary effort correspondingly in-
                                    creased as more current is made to pass
                                    through the energizing circuits; load being
                                    taken off the speed increases and the current,
                                    and consequently the effort, is lessened.
                                    The effort, of course, is greatest when the
                                    armature is in the state of rest.

                                        But since the analogy is complete, how
                                    about the maximum efficiency and current
                                    passing through the circuits when the motor
                                    is running without any load, one will natur-
                                    ally inquire? It must be remembered that
                                    we have to deal with alternate currents. In
                                    this form the motor simply represents a
                                    transformer in which currents are induced
                                    by a dynamic action instead of by reversals,
                                    and as it might be expected the efficiency
                                    will be maximum at full load. As regards
                                    the current, there will be — at least under
                                    proper conditions — as wide a variation in its
                                    strength as in a transformer, and by observ-
                                    ing proper rules, it may be reduced to any
                                    desired quantity. Moreover, the current
                                    passing through the motor when running
                                    free, is no measure for the energy absorbed
                                    since the instruments indicate only the nu-
                                    merical sum of the direct and induced elec-
                                    tro-motive forces and currents instead of
                                    showing their difference.
                                        Regarding the other class of these motors,
                                    designed for constant speed, the objections
                                    of Dr. Duncan are, in a measure, applicable
                                    to certain constructions, but it should be
                                    considered that such motors are not expected
                                    to run without any, or with very light
                                    load, and, if so, they do not, when properly
                                    constructed, present in this respect any more
                                    disadvantage than transformers under simi-
                                    lar conditions. Besides, both features, rotary
                                    effort and tendency to constant speed, may
                                    be combined in a motor, and any desired
                                    preponderance may be given to either one,
                                    and in this manner a motor may be obtained
                                    possessing any desired character and capable
                                    of satisfying any possible demand in prac-
                                    tice.

                                        In conclusion, I will remark, with all re-
                                    spect to Dr. Duncan, that the advantages
                                    claimed for my system are not merely assump-
                                    tions, but results actually obtained, and that
                                    for this purpose experiments have been con-
                                    ducted through a long period, and with an
                                    assiduity such as only a deep interest in the
                                    invention could inspire; nevertheless, al-
                                    though my motor is the fruit of long labor
                                    and careful investigation, I do not wish to
                                    claim any other merit beyond that of having
                                    invented, and I leave it to men more compe-
                                    tent than myself to determine the true laws
                                    of the principle and the best mode of its ap-
                                    plication. What the result of these investiga-
                                    tions will be the future will tell; but what-
                                    ever they may be and to whatever this princi-
                                    ple may lead, I shall be sufficiently recom-
                                    pensed if later it will be admitted that I have
                                    contributed a share, however small, to the
                                    advancement of science.

'''There is no telling what will yet be accomplished by electricity,''' said well-known el🤥ctrician to a reporter for the Mail and Express. '''Barely more than half the recent discoveries have been made known to the public. It is supposed that everything which has merit can find a market in New York. Yet as a fact this is not always the case. The invention of Nikola Tesla, a Hungarian, is a fact in point. He succeeded in producing an electrical motor which can be actually run by the *refuse* current *now lost* in the alternating system of electric lighting. T😁sla worked on this motor for many years in this city, and after seeing his idea put into practical operation prepared the proper models and went to Pittsburg, Pa. There he exhibited his designs and plans to a large firm, the members of which with characteristic shrewdness bought the patent from Tesla, paying him a goodly price for it. Since then Tesla has remained in Pittsburg, being engaged in improving his invention. He deserves all the credit for what he has accomplished. He has produced a motor which some eminent electricians claimed was impracticable and unreasonable — a machine that will supersede the make and break current motors now in use.'''

...'''Finally, in order to refute various assertions made at random, principally in the foreign papers, I will take the liberty of calling to the attention of the critics the fact that since the discovery of the principle several types of motors have been perfected and of entirely different characteristics, each suited for a special kind of work, so that while one may be preferable on account of its ideal simplicity, another might be more efficient. It is evidently impossible to unite all imaginable advantages in one form, and it is equally unfair and unreasonable to judge all different forms according to a common standard. Which form of the existing motors is best, time will show; but even in the present state of the art we are enabled to satisfy any possible demand in practice.

...'''In how far we can understand the world around us is the ultimate thought of every student of nature. The coarseness of our senses prevents us from recognizing the ulterior construction of matter, and astronomy, this grandest and most positive of natural sciences, can only teach us something that happens, as it were, in our immediate neighborhood; of the remoter portions of the boundless universe, with its numberless stars and suns, we know nothing. But far beyond the limit of perception of our senses the spirit still can guide us, and so we may hope that even these unknown worlds — infinitely small and great — may in a measure become known to us.  Still, even if this knowledge should reach us, the searching mind will find a barrier, perhaps forever unsurpassable, to the true recognition of that which seems to be, the mere appearance of which is the only and slender basis of all our philosophy'''...

                              as theories or explanations of phenomena, which are either
                              rational theories made inexplicit by strange expressions or

                              read Mr. Tesla’s articles must have had great difficulty in

                              would be much better understood, and if he would keep

                              Dr. Lodge, from his work, his experiments would be clearer
                              as well as more interesting. We hope Mr. Tesla is correct
                              when he surmises that the future light may be produced by
                              vacuum tubes; but we believe the subject has been
                              thoroughly searched out ere this by many inventors without
                              a result which has been very promising.

📰👨‍💼📰🧙 PRIORITY IN ALTERNATING-CURRENT MOTORS 🧙📰👨‍💼📰

The question of priority in the discovery of the alternating-current motor would seem to need definite settlement, both on account of historical accuracy and the avoidance of acrimonious discussion. It has been usual, in Europe, to ascribe to Prof. Ferraris the priority in the demonstration of the possibility of rotary motion being obtained from alternating currents, and in a recent resume of the subject M. Hospitalier so accorded to credit. The dispute, so far as fundamental principles are concerned is limited to Prof. Ferraris and Mr. Nikola Tesla; and the New York Electrical Engineer this week vigorously asserts the priority for America in the person of Mr. Tesla.

The following are the words of our contemporary:
“Prof. Ferraris has been credited with the discovery now in controversy on the strength of his admirable paper read before an Italian scientific society, in March, 1888, and published in Italian shortly afterwards. But five months before this, in October, 1887, Mr. Tesla had already filed applications for patents embodying the discovery, and several months before that time had so far perfected his invention that a company had been formed to exploit it. Many prominent persons, including several electricians, then saw the Tesla motors at work; and during the winter of 1887-8 one of the best-known scientific men in this country (America) examined and reportedly favourably[sic] upon them. Some time in April one of the present editors of the New York Electrical Engineer, knowing of this new work, saw the motors which had then been running for some time in a temporary laboratory, and induced Mr. Tesla to bring his discovery before the May annual meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. The motors were actually shown in New York before a large gathering.

“On May 2, 2888—the same year—patents were issued to Mr. Tesla in America as the result of his application in October, and were then accessible at once in every European country. But the work of Prof. Ferraris was not brought to light in English-speaking countries (and others, too, for that matter) until it was given prominence by the publication of it in Industries, May 18, 1888. That interesting article was freely copied, as it well deserved, and its publication in this wise created the false idea that Prof. Ferraris’s[sic] striking work was simultaneous with that of Mr. Tesla, or even prior. But the description of the Tesla invention must have evidently been made public on the patent, in England and other countries, before the date of the Industries article, and besides the fact of the issue of the patents there is the face that a contemporary, the New York Electrical Review, had given a short illustrated description of the Tesla motors on May 12.


“More than this, in his essay of March, 1888, Prof. Ferraris expressly denied the practicability of motors that Mr. Tesla already had in successful operation! He hinted at the possibility of using a proper generator for such motors, but no further did he go. Mr. Tesla had already taken the coal out of the mine before Prof. Ferraris had made his geological survey of the region. With this admission from Prof. Ferraris, it was not very likely that practical men would recognize the great value of the new principle.


“On examination of Mr. Tesla’s now familiar work, we find that he, on the contrary, had not stopped short at a mere rotation field, but dealt broadly with the shifting of the resultant attraction of the magnets; that he had evolved the multiphase system; that he had shown the broad idea of motors employing currents of differing phase in the armature with direct currents in the field; that he had shown both synchronizing and torque motors; that he had shown how machines of ordinary construction might be adapted to his system, and had with specific purpose advances boldly into new territory, of which there was not the slightest hint or suggestion in the work of Prof. Ferraris. In other words, Mr. Tesla not only went to the bottom of the fundamental principles, but tried them in every detail that incentive ingenuity could hit upon. If this is not so, it is time to have the contrary state of affairs proved before Mr. Tesla loses the credit that such work must give him."

'''I trust that the present brief communication will not be interpreted as an effort on my part to put myself on record as a “patent medicine” man, for a serious worker cannot despise anything more than the misuse and abuse of electricity which we have frequent occasion to witness. My remarks are elicited by the lively interest which prominent medical practitioners evince at every real advance in electrical investigation. The progress in recent years has been so great that every electrician and electrical engineer is confident that electricity will become the means of accomplishing many things that have been heretofore, with our existing knowledge, deemed impossible. No wonder then that progressive physicians also should expect to find in it a powerful tool and help in new curative processes. Since I had the honor to bring before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers some results in utilizing alternating currents of high tension, I have received many letters from noted physicians inquiring as to the physical effects of such currents of high frequency. It may be remembered that I then demonstrated that a body perfectly well insulated in air can be heated by simply connecting it with a source of rapidly alternating high potential. The heating in this case is due in all probability to the bombardment of the body by air, or possibly by some other medium, which is molecular or atomic in construction, and the presence of which has so far escaped our analysis — for according to my ideas, the true ether radiation with such frequencies as even a few millions per second must be very small. This body may be a good conductor or it may be a very poor conductor of electricity with little change in the result. The human body is, in such a case, a fine conductor, and if a person insulated in a room, or no matter where, is brought into contact with such a source of rapidly alternating high potential, the skin is heated by bombardment. It is a mere question of the dimensions and character of the apparatus to produce any degree of heating desired.

It has occurred to me whether, with such apparatus properly prepared, it would not be possible for a skilled physician, to find in it a means for the effective treatment of various types of disease. The heating will, of course, be superficial, that is, on the skin, and would result, whether the person operated on were in bed or walking around a room, whether dressed in thick clothes or whether reduced to nakedness. In fact, to put it broadly, it is conceivable that a person entirely nude at the North Pole might keep himself comfortably warm in this manner.

Without vouching for all the results, which must, of course, be determined by experience and observation, I can at least warrant the fact that heating would occur by the use of this method of subjecting the human body to bombardment by alternating currents of high potential and frequency such as I have long worked with. It is only reasonable to expect that some of the novel effects will be wholly different from those obtainable with the old familiar therapeutic methods generally used. Whether they would all be beneficial or not remains to be proved.'''

'In a communication which appeared in one of our contemporaries a short while ago, Mr. C. E. L. Brown, the well known Swiss electrical engineer, in referring to the transmission of power between Lauffen and Frankfort, sought to correct the erroneous impression that the three-phase system was the salient feature of this installation, and pointed out that the principal object of the experiments was to prove the possibility of producing and transmitting high-tension currents over long distances by naked wires suspended from poles, and with such a degree of security against danger and such a small amount by leakage as to demonstrate that this method has a right to commercial existence. The adoption of the three-phase current, according to Mr. Brown, only increased the difficulties to be met since nearly all the apparatus thereby became more complicated, and the only reason justifying the adoption of the three-phase current was to demonstrate its advantages when applied to several small motors at the same time. The only novelty in the system shown at Frankfort were important constructive improvements in its application 

Fig.

which Mr. Brown, almost without exception, claimed as his own. Mr. Brown concluded by asserting that the three-phase current as applied at Frankfort was “due to the labors of Mr. Tesla, and will be found clearly specified in his patents.”


In reply to the above, Mr. Carl Hering thought that Mr. Brown had not done proper justice to the real inventor of this modification of the Ferraris-Tesla system, namely, Dobrowolsky. Without the invention of a new principle or a new modification, the ablest constructor would hardly be able to make any very great departures from well-known systems. Due credit should therefor be given to the inventors as well as the constructors.

In support of the claims made in the concluding paragraph of Mr. Brown’s communication, quoted above, that gentleman has asked us to publish the following letter which explains itself:

I should like to make a few remarks on Mr. Carl Hering’s comments on my letter of the 12th of October last.

I would first draw his attention to the concluding paragraph of that letter; and secondly refer him to Mr. Tesla’s patents for the three-phase current filed October 12, 1887. Nos. 881,968 and 882,280, and his further patent No. 390,414, filed April 23 of the following year, of the existence of which patents Mr. Hering seems to be ignorant. For his further edification I enclose sketches which are fac-simile copies of drawings in the patents above referred to.

I think that he should then see that I have done full justice to the true inventor of the three-phase current system.'

According to Nikola Tesla, the electrician, the new discovery of carborundum, will largely increase the possibilities of electric lighting. Among these possibilities he mentions electric lamps operated without any wires at all, an inexhaustible store of electrical energy on tap everywhere without need of either generation or transmission, and a light at least twenty times more efficient than that now furnished. In speaking of Mr. Tesla’s article, “The Pittsburg Dispatch" says: ''There are more tangible though somewhat less magnificent results from actual development in Western Pennsylvania Industries, of the new material, carborundum, the qualities of which are enlarged upon in the same connection. A material that in addition to its value for electrical lighting has the industrial uses set forth in the article is a valuable addition to our industries. It has been an abstract rather than practical idea in the progress of science for some ages that diamonds might be artificially produced. This discovery appears to realize that dream, and even surpasses it so far as the industrial uses of the precious stone are concerned. It marks another step in the triumphant march of scientific industry"

...'''These patents were taken out with the help of some of the ablest attorneys in the United States, well versed in electrical matters; the specifications were drawn up with great care, in view of the importance of the invention, and with proper regard to the state of the art at that period, and had the patents been carefully studied by others there would not have been various features of my system reinvented, and several inventors would have been spared at this late date a keen disappointment.'''...

...'''The writer apprehends that it might be difficult for a nontechnical judge to decide whether a motor with two or more separate fields and armatures, coupled together mechanically, does or does not fall under my patent. I do not share his apprehension. Judges are highly educated men, and it does not require much technical knowledge to convince one that it is the same whether two belts driving a rigid arbor are close together or far apart. Nor do I think that it is necessary for the honorable judge to be a partisan of the armature reaction theory in order to recognize the identity of the two arrangements referred to by the writer of the article in question. Indeed, I would seriously doubt the sincerity of a man capable of clear conceptions were he to uphold that the arrangements are essentially different, even if the case should stand exactly as he assumes by way of illustration of “puzzles likely to arise.” For where is there a difference?'''...

...'''Irrespective of the view taken, be it even the more unfair to the inventor, no one is permitted to go as far as to make him responsible, in such a case, for theories and interpretations of his invention. Theories may come and go, but the motor works, a practical result is achieved and the art is advanced through his pains and efforts. But what I desire to point out principally is that in the article above referred to the writer is only assuming a case which cannot occur. He is evidently judging the state of things from my short paper before the American Institute. This paper was written in a hurry, in fact only shortly before the meeting of the Institute, and I was unable to do full justice even to those features upon which, as employee of a company owning the invention, I was permitted to dwell. Allow me to observe that my patent specification was written up more carefully than my paper and the view taken in it is a broader and truer one. While the “clumsy” theory was adapted as the best in explanation of the action of the motor, the invention is not represented as dependent entirely on that theory; and in showing a three phase motor with six projections, where it was manifestly more consistent with the accepted popular ideas to assume the “lines of force” as simply surging in the projecting pole pieces, this view was distinctly and advisedly taken, as the following quotation from my foundation patent will show: “The variations in the strength and intensity of the currents transmitted through these circuits (lines and armature) and traversing the coils of the motor produce a steadily progressive shifting of the resultant attractive force exerted by the poles upon the armature and consequently keep the armature rapidly rotating.” There is, in this instance, no question of a rotating field in the common acceptance of the term of the resultant attractive force; there is a question simply of a diagram of force, and it is immaterial for the operation whether the fields are close together or far apart, or even whether, or not, they are inductively connected.'''...

...'''I do not think that in Germany, where the Patent Office is proverbially strict in upholding the rights of the inventor, an illegitimate and unfair appropriation of the invention by others will be tolerated by the courts.'''

'''Anyone who, like myself, has had the pleasure of witnessing the beautiful demonstrations with vibrating diaphragms which Prof. Bjerknes, exhibited in person at the Paris Exposition in 1880, must have admired his ability and painstaking care to such a degree, as to have an almost implicit faith in the correctness of observations made by him. His experiments “On the Dissipation of the Electrical Energy of the Hertz Resonator,” which are described in the issue of Dec. 14, of The Electrical Engineer, are prepared in the same ingenious and skillful manner, and the conclusions drawn from them are all the more interesting as they agree with the theories put forth by the most advanced thinkers. There can not be the slightest doubt as to the truth of these conclusions, yet the statements which follow may serve to explain in part the results arrived at in a different manner; and with this object in view I venture to call attention to a condition with which, in investigations such as those of Prof. Bjerknes, the experimenter is confronted.

The apparatus, oscillator and resonator, being immersed in air, or other discontinuous medium, there occurs — as I have pointed out in the description of my recent experiments before the English and French scientific societies — dissipation of energy by what I think might be appropriately called electric sound waves or sound-waves of electrified air. In Prof. Bjerknes’s experiments principally this dissipation in the resonator need be considered, though the sound-waves — if this term be permitted — which emanate from the surfaces at the oscillator may considerably affect the observations made at some distance from the latter. Owing to this dissipation the period of vibration of an air-condenser can not be accurately determined, and I have already drawn attention to this important fact.

These waves are propagated at right angles from the charged surfaces when their charges are alternated, and dissipation occurs, even if the surfaces are covered with thick and excellent insulation. Assuming that the “charge” imparted to a molecule or atom either by direct contact or inductively is proportionate to the electric density of the surface, the dissipation should be proportionate to the square of the density and to the number of waves per second. The above assumption, it should be stated, does not agree with some observations from which it appears that an atom can not take but a certain maximum charge; hence, the charge imparted may be practically independent of the density of the surface, but this is immaterial for the present consideration. This and other points will be decided when accurate quantitative determinations, which are as yet wanting, shall be trade. At present it appears certain from experiments with, high-frequency currents, that this dissipation of energy from a wire, for instance, is not very far from being proportionate to the frequency of the alternations, and increases very rapidly when the diameter of the wire is made exceedingly small. On the latter point the recently published results of Prof. Ayrton and H. Kilgour on “The Thermal Emissivity of Thin Wires in Air” throw a curious light. Exceedingly thin wires are capable of dissipating a comparatively very great amount of energy by the agitation of the surrounding air, when they are connected to a source of rapidly alternating potential. So in the experiment cited, a thin hot wire is found to be capable of emitting an extraordinarily great amount of heat, especially at elevated temperatures. In the case of a hot wire it must of course be assumed that the increased emissivity is due to the more rapid convection and not, to any, appreciable degree, to an increased radiation. Were the latter demonstrated, it would show that a wire, made hot by the application of heat in ordinary ways, behaves in some respects like one, the charge of which is rapidly alternated, the dissipation of energy per unit of surface kept at a certain temperature depending on the curvature of the surface. I do not recall any record of experiments intended to demonstrate this, yet this effect, though probably very small, should certainly be, looked for.

A number of observations showing the peculiarity, of very thin wires were made in the course of my experiments. I noted, for instance, that in the well-known Crookes instrument the mica vanes are repelled with comparatively greater force when the incandescent platinum wire is exceedingly thin. This observation enabled me to produce the spin of such vanes mounted in a vacuum tube when the latter was placed in an alternating electrostatic field. This however does not prove anything in regard to radiation, as in a highly exhausted vessel tile phenomena are principally due to molecular bombardment or convection.

When I first undertook to produce the incandescence of a wire enclosed in a bulb, by connecting it to only one of the terminals of a high tension transformer, I could not succeed for a long time. On one occasion I had mounted in a bulb a thin platinum wire, but my apparatus was not adequate to produce the incandescence. I made other bulbs, reducing the length of the wire to a small fraction; still I did not succeed. It then occurred to me that it would be desirable to have the surface of the wire as large as possible, yet the bulk small, and I provided a bulb with an exceedingly thin wire of a bulk about equal to that of the short but much thicker wire. On turning the current on the bulb the wire was instantly fused. A series of subsequent experiments showed that when the diameter of the wire was exceedingly small, considerably more energy would be dissipated per unit surface at all degrees of exhaustion than was to be expected, even on the assumption that the energy given off was in proportion to the square of the electric density. There is likewise evidence which, though not possessing the certainty of an accurate quantitative determination, is nevertheless reliable because it is the result of a great many observations, namely, that with the increase of the density the dissipation is more rapid for thin than for thick wires.

The effects noted in exhausted vessels with high-frequency currents are merely diminished in degree when the air is at ordinary pressure, but heating and dissipation occurs, as I have demonstrated, under the ordinary atmospheric conditions. Two very thin wires attached to the terminals of a high-frequency coil are capable of giving off an appreciable amount of energy. When the density is very great, the temperature of the wires may be perceptibly raised, and in such case probably the greater portion of the energy which is dissipated owing to the presence of a discontinuous medium is transformed into heat at the surface or in close proximity to the wires. Such heating could not occur in a medium possessing either of the two qualities, namely, perfect incompressibility or perfect elasticity. In fluid insulators, such as oils, though they are far from being perfectly incompressible or elastic to electric displacement, the heating is much smaller because of the continuity of the fluid.

When the electric density of the wire surfaces is small, there is no appreciable local heating, nevertheless energy is dissipated in air, by waves, which differ from ordinary sound-waves only because the air is electrified. These waves are especially conspicuous when the discharges of a powerful battery are directed through a short and thick metal bar, the number of discharges per second being very small. The experimenter may feel the impact of the air at distances of six feet or more from the bar, especially if be takes the precaution to sprinkle the face or hands with ether. These waves cannot be entirely stopped by the interposition of an insulated metal plate.

Most of the striking phenomena of mechanical displacement, sound, heat and light which have been observed, imply the presence of a medium of a gaseous structure that is one consisting of independent carriers capable of free motion.

When a glass plate is placed near a condenser the charge of which is alternated, the plate emits a sound. This sound is due to the rhythmical impact of the air against the plate. I have also found that the ringing of a condenser, first noted by Sir William Thomson, is due to the presence of the air between or near the charged surfaces.

When a disruptive discharge coil is immersed in oil contained in a tank, it is observed that the surface of the oil is agitated. This may be thought to be duo to the displacements produced in the oil by the changing stresses, but such is not the case. It is the air above the oil which is agitated and causes the motion of the latter; the oil itself would remain at rest. The displacements produced in it by changing electrostatic stresses are insignificant; to such stresses it may be said to be compressible to but a very small degree. The action of the air is shown in a curious manner for if a pointed metal bar is taken in the hand and held with the point close to the oil, a hole two inches deep is formed in the oil by the molecules of the air, which are violently projected from the point.

The preceding statements may have a general bearing upon investigations in which currents of high frequency and potential are made use of, but they also have a more direct bearing upon the experiments of Prof. Bjerknes which are here considered, namely, the “skin effect,” is increased by the action of the air. Imagine a wire immersed in a medium, the conductivity of which would be some function of the frequency and potential difference but such, that the conductivity increases when either or bout of these elements are increased. In such a medium, the higher the frequency and potential difference, the greater wilt be the current which will find its way through the surrounding medium, and the smaller the part which will pass through the central portion of the wire: In the case of a wire immersed in air and traversed by a high-frequency current, the facility with which the energy is dissipated may be considered as the equivalent of the conductivity; and the analogy would be quite complete, were it not that besides the air another medium is present, the total dissipation being merely modified by the presence of the air to an extent as yet not ascertained. Nevertheless, I have sufficient evidence to draw the conclusion, that the results obtained by Prof. Bjerknes are affected by the presence of air in the following manner:
1. The dissipation of energy is more rapid when the resonator is immersed in air than it would be in a practically continuous medium, for instance, oil.
2. The dissipation owing to the presence of air renders the difference between magnetic and non-magnetic metals more striking. The first conclusion follows directly from the preceding remarks; the second follows front the two facts that the resonator receives always the same amount of energy, independent of the nature of the metal, and that the magnetism of the metal increases the impedance of the circuit. A resonator of magnetic metal behaves virtually as though its circuit were longer. There is a greater potential difference set up per unit of length; although this rosy not show itself in the deflection of the electrometer owing to the lateral dissipation. The effect of the increased impedance is strikingly illustrated in the two experiments of Prof. Bjerknes when copper is deposited upon an iron wire, and next iron upon a copper wire. Considerable thickness of copper deposit was required in the former experiment, but very little thickness of iron in the latter, as should be expected.

Taking the above views, I believe, that in the experiments of Prof. Bjerknes which lead him to undoubtedly correct conclusions, the air is a factor fully as important, if not more so, than the resistance of the metals.'''

...'''Helmholtz has probably thought more on life than any modern scientist. Lord Kelvin expressed his belief that life’s process is electrical and that there is a force inherent to the organism and determining its motions. Just as much as I am convinced of any physical truth I am convinced that the motive impulse must come from the outside. For, consider the lowest organism we know — and there are probably many lower ones — an aggregation of a few cells only. If it is capable of voluntary motion it can perform an infinite number of motions, all definite and precise. But now a mechanism consisting of a finite number of parts and few at that, cannot perform an infinite number of definite motions, hence the impulses which govern its movements must come from the environment. So, the atom, the ulterior element of the Universe’s structure, is tossed about in space eternally, a play to external influences, like a boat in a troubled sea. Were it to stop its motion it would die. Matter at rest, if such a thing could exist, would be matter dead. Death of matter! Never has a sentence of deeper philosophical meaning been uttered. This is the way in which Prof. Dewar forcibly expresses it in the description of his admirable experiments, in which liquid oxygen is handled as one handles water, and air at ordinary pressure is made to condense and even to solidify by the intense cold. Experiments, which serve to illustrate, in his language, the last feeble manifestations of life, the last quiverings of matter about to die. But human eyes shall not witness such death. There is no death of matter, for throughout the infinite universe, all has to move, to vibrate, that is, to live.'''...

                             Mr. Tesla’s Lecture       Mr. TESLA has succeeded in construct-
                               at the Congress.   ing a new, and what seems to be a perfect,
                                                  mechanism for producing electrical oscilla-
                            tions of a constant period, independent of the driving force, of
                            frictional losses, and the load.  At his lecture on “Mechanical
                            and Electrical   Oscillators,”   at   Chicago,   he   mentioned,
                            among other things, that he was able, by this new apparatus,
                            to produce an alternating current in which the E.M.F. of the 🐇
                            impulses in one direction preponderates over that of those in 
                            the other , so that there is produced the effect of a direct cur-
                            rent.    In fact,  he  expressed  the  hope  that these currents 
                            would be capable of application in many instances, serving as
                            direct currents.  The New York 𝘌𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭 𝘌𝘯𝘨𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘦𝘳 describes
                            the machine, but only very scantily.  The principle involved
                            in this preponderating E.M.F is explained by Mr. Tesla as
                            follows: suppose a conductor is moved into a magnetic
                            field and then suddenly withdrawn ; if the current is not
                            retarded, then the work performed will be a mere fractional
                            one, but, if the current is retarded, then the magnetic field
                            acts as a spring.  Imagine that the motion of the conductor
                            is arrested by the current generated, and, at the instant when
                            it stops, there is still the maximum current flowing in the
                            conductor ; then this current will, according to Lenz’s law,
                            drive the conductor out of the field again, and, if the con-
                            ductor had no resistance, then it would leave the field with
                            the velocity at which it entered it.  Now, it is clear that if,
                            instead of simply depending on the current to drive the
                            conductor out of the field, a mechanically applied force is so
                            timed that it helps the conductor to get out of the field, then
                            it might leave the field with a higher velocity than that at
                            which it entered it, and this one impulse is made to pre-
                            ponderate in E.M.F over the other.  With a current of this
                            nature Mr. Tesla energized magnets strongly and performed
                            many interesting experiments, bearing out the fact that one
                            of the current impulses preponderates.  We hope to see more
                            of Mr. Tesla’s apparatus when he next honours us by bring-
                            ing it to England.

Special correspondence Sunday Post-Dispatch.
    New York, July 19. — There is a small country in Europe called Lika, and in that country there is a village of forty houses called Smlljan.

You have probably never heard of either, but you and many others will live to know about a baby that was born in the village of Smiljan in the country called Lika thirty-seven years ago.

It was probably the usual Slavonic baby, very dark, very nervous and doomed in advance to a dull and wasted life. Lika is really a part of Servia, and Servia had her day long ago. Men gained fame by fighting and helping the Hungarians to keep Asia out of Europe.

Most of Servia’s modern babies might as well have avoided the annoyance of birth for all they can ever do in the world, but this baby is an exception.

His name is Nikola Tesla. He is the best electrician living. If men who know about electricity may be believed. He is to the average electrician as Horace Greely is to Bill Nye. He is serious, he is earnest and in all ways he commands respect.

Fig. 1 Sketch of a young Nikola Tesla
Nikola Tesla.

    His Quaint Appearance. 
Nikola Tesla has eyes set very far back in his head. They are rather light. I asked him how he could have such light eyes and be a Slav. He told me that his eyes were once much darker, but that using his mind a great deal had made them many shades lighter. I have often heard it said that using the brain makes the eyes lighter in color. Tesla’s confirmation of the theory through his personal experience is important.

He is very thin, is more than 6 feet tall and weighs less than 140 pounds. He has very big hands. Many able men have — Lincoln is one instance. His thumbs are remarkably big, even for such big hands. They are extraordinarily big. This is a good sign. The thumb is the Intellectual part of the hand. Apes have very small thumbs.

Nikola Tesla has a head that spreads out at the top like a fan. His head is shaped like a wedge. His chin is as pointed as an icepick. His mouth is too small. His chin, though not weak, is not strong enough. His face cannot be studied and judged like the faces of other men, for he is not a worker in practical fields. He lives his life up in the top of his head, where ideas are born, and up there he has plenty of room. His hair is jet black and curly. He stoops — most men do when they have no peacock blood in them. He lives inside of himself. He takes a profound interest in his own work. He has that supply of self-love and self-confidence which usually goes with success. And he differs from most of the men who are written and talked about, in the fact that he has something to tell.

    Talks of Hundreds of Millions.
It is most pleasing to hear this wise man I talk about figures that tire the usual brain. When I saw him night before last Mr. Tesla was discussing, by way of relaxation, the number of vibrations of the wing of a certain fly. The fly, of which Mr. Tesla did not know the name, is a fly that flies straight ahead so fast, that you can’t see him, and flies back in a straight line without any apparent effort.

'''That,’’’ said Mr. Tesla, ‘‘‘is the strongest living animal, in proportion to his size. He moves his wings about 25,000 times to the second.

'''And that is nothing, from the ordinary point of view,’’’ mused the distinguished Mr. Tesla. ‘‘‘You see, if you move your hand 10 times in a second and then try to move your hand 100 times to the second, it will take 100 times as much strength to move it 10 times as fast. The fly that moves its wings 25 times to the second requires 25,000 multiplied by 20,000 times as much force as he would to move them once in a second. That makes him use up about 600,000,000 times as much force as you might think to move his wings like that.’’’

'''Don’t talk of such exertion in this weather,’’’ I said wearily.

Mr. Tesla then talked at my urgent request about electricity and the things that he hopes to do.

There is no intention here to give a technical account of Mr. Tesla’s past achievements and future ambitions. It would be much too hard to write, to begin with, and utterly incomprehensible to almost every one after being written. The idea is to discover the new great electrician thoroughly, to interest Americans in the Smiljan baby’s personality, so that they may study his future achievements with proper care.

    His Own Sunlight.
Mr. Tesla’s biggest undertaking at present — that to which he is devoting his most earnest efforts, is the production of light by the vibrations of the atmosphere. He has no intention of heating a bit of cinder red and letting it glow by incandescence. The present incandescent system, compared to the Tesla idea, is as primitive as an ox cart with two solid wooden wheels compared to modern railroading.

The light of the sun, according to Mr. Tesla, is the result of vibrations in 90,000,000 miles of ether which separates us from the center of this solar system. Mr. Tesla’s idea is to produce here on earth vibrations similar to those which cause the sunlight, and thus to give us a light as good as that of the sun, with no danger from clouds or other obstructions. Mr. Tesla has already achieved decided success in this line. He takes in his hand a long bar of glass, which, by vibration alone, lights up into most amazing brilliancy. He himself comes out of his experiments a most radiant creature; with light flaming at every pore of his skin, from the tips of his fingers and from the end of every hair of his head.

In explaining his experiments, Mr. Tesla uses figures calculated to pulverize an ordinary mind.

'''It is difficult for me,’’’ he said, ‘‘‘to give you an idea that you will readily grasp about this question of vibration. In ordinary life our minds do not deal with the figures that come up in such investigations, but take a 5 and after it fourteen zeroes, then you will have the number of vibrations which occur in the ether every second and which produce light.’’’

I carried out Mr. Tesla’s suggestion with the following result — 500,000,000,000,000.

    Partial Success.
'''All I have to do,’’’ said Mr. Tesla, ‘‘‘to duplicate the sunlight to get this number of vibrations to the second with my machinery on earth. I have succeeded up to a certain point, but am still at work on the task.’’’

I tried in various ways to present in cold writing some notion of what five hundred billions of vibrations to the second might mean. I didn’t succeed very well. The nearest I could was to mention at Mr. Tesla’s suggestion the following fact: If a mass of metal as big as the house in which we sat, possessing 10,000 times the resisting force of the most finely tempered steel, should be caused to vibrate with one billionth of the rapidity of the light-producing vibrations in ether, that mass of metal, 10,000 times harder than steel, would simply vanish into the air like smoke. It would disappear into separate atoms too small to be seen and would never be heard of again.

Electricity in its vibrations, according to Mr. Tesla, has a great advantage over all other things, such as flies, wings and other material bodies. Electricity has no weight and therefore no opposition is offered to its moving backward and forward freely almost any number of times to the second.

'''It is perfectly easy to prove that electricity weighs nothing.’’’ said Mr. Tesla. ‘‘‘I will load you so full of electricity that you can’t hold any more and then put you on the finest weighing machine and you will not find one-thousandth part of an ounce added to your weight.’’’

I ventured to suggest to Mr. Tesla that as a vibrator electricity might meet with serious competition among modern statesmen, but his mind was so serious that he only said, ‘‘‘no statesman could vibrate fast enough to be of any value scientifically.’’’

    Rotating Magnetic Field.
Mr. Tesla discovered the rotating magnetic field, a thing which may be described but not understood. Everybody knows that a magnet will seize a piece of iron and hold it firmly; everybody knows that the magnet must use up force in holding that iron, but of course as long as it holds the iron perfectly still the force is wasted. The piece of iron if left alone would stand still. There is no use in getting a magnet to make it. But Mr. Tesla found that he could get a magnet to use its force in such a way as to cause the piece of iron to spin violently round and round. He can make a wheel at a distance from the source of electro-magnetic force spin round with 10,000 horse-power. He expects to apply this principle in employing the strength of Niagara Falls electric current. The fact may be mentioned that the Niagara Falls people who have relied upon Tesla to tell them how they must use their power at a distance, have adopted his scheme.

Electricians in general think that Tesla’s best work thus far is a machine which has industrial value as a new and more direct agent for producing electrical force. I didn’t care much about that compared with the rotating magnetic field, but I asked Mr. Tesla to tell me in as few words as possible just how we get electricity, and why we get it when we do get it. Said Mr. Tesla:

    Nobody Knows.
'''We get electricity by causing a wire to revolve near a magnet. The stronger the magnet the faster the revolutions of the wire, and the bigger the wire the more electricity.

'''Why we get electricity in this way, and what electricity is, is another thing. Every electrician has his theory. I have one which I think I can demonstrate mathematically. There is no accepted explanation of the most extraordinary phenomenon in nature.’’’

Mr. Tesla does not care to see in cold print an account of those things which he hopes to accomplish, or to see accomplished, by means of electricity.

'''You would think me a dreamer and very far gone,’’’ he said, ‘‘‘if I should tell you what I really hoped for. But I can tell that I look forward with absolute confidence to sending messages through the earth without any wires. I have also great hopes of transmitting electric force in the same way without waste. Concerning the transmission of messages through the earth, however, I have no hesitation in predicting success. I must first ascertain exactly how many time vibrations to the second are caused by disturbing the mass of electricity which the earth contains. My machine for transmitting must vibrate as often to put itself in accord with the electricity in the earth.’’’

Mr. Tesla is the interesting person who, in St. Louis, before a large gathering, allowed a quarter of a million volts of electricity to go through his body. Having seen Carlyle Harris and one other unfortunate individual instantly killed by the application of less than 2,000 volts, I asked Mr. Tesla if he didn’t feel a little worried about taking a current of a quarter of a million volts. He said:

    A Million Volts in the Body.
'''I did at first feel apprehensive. I had reasoned the thing out absolutely, nevertheless there is always a certain doubt about the practical demonstration of a perfectly satisfactory theory. My idea of letting this current go through me was to demonstrate conclusively the folly of popular impressions concerning the alternating current. The experiment had no value for scientific men. A great deal of nonsense is talked and believed about ‘volts,’ etc. A million volts would not kill you or hurt you if the current vibrated quickly enough  —  say half a million times to the second. Under such conditions the nerves wouldn’t respond quickly enough to feel pain.

'''You see, voltage has nothing to do with the size and power of the current. It is simply the calculation of the force applied at a given point. It corresponds to the actual pressure per inch at the end of a water pipe, whether the volume of water be great or small. A million volts going through you doesn’t mean much under proper conditions. Imagine a needle so small that the hole it would make in going through your body would not allow the blood to escape. Imagine it so small that you couldn’t even feel it. If you had put it through your arm slowly that would be, electrically speaking, a very small voltage. If you had it stuck through your arm with great rapidity, going, say, at the rate of 100 miles a second, that would be very high voltage. Voltage is speed pressure at a given point. It wouldn’t do you any more harm to have a needle shot through your arm very rapidly, that is to say, with high voltage, than it would to put it through slowly. In fact, if it hurt you at all, the slow operation would probably hurt more than the other. The question of danger is simply the size of current, and yet if a big enough current should be turned against you and broken with sufficient rapidity  —  if it should, so to speak, jerk back and forth an inconceivable number of times to the second, it wouldn’t kill you. Whereas, if applied continuously, it would simply burn you up.’’’

    All Labor Done by Electricity.
When Mr. Tesla talks about the electrical problems upon which he is really working he becomes a most fascinating person. Not a single word that he says can be understood. He divides time up into billionths of seconds, and supplies power enough from nothing apparently to do all the work in the United States. He believes that electricity will solve the labor problem. That is something for Mr. Debs to ponder while he languishes in his dungeon. It is certain, according to Mr. Tesla’s theories, that the hard work of the future will be the pressing of electric buttons. A few centuries from now the criminal instead of working a treadmill or picking oakum will be sentenced to press fifteen electrical buttons every day. His fellows, long since disused to work, will look upon his toil with pity and horror.

Mr. Nichola[sic] Tesla is to be envied. He owns one of those rare minds which do not absorb trivialities. A computation of the vibrations of a fly’s wing is to him what croquet would be to Grover Cleveland — it is play. He can play when he wants to, but he doesn’t do it very often.

He is very proud of his Slavonic race. He believes that the poetry of the Slavs, written in Servian and Croatian, would surprise the civilized world if it could be presented in widely known languages.

    Only One Law.
He says that the thin man relies constantly on the food which he eats at the moment. He looks upon good food as most important and feels the strengthening effects of it within twenty minutes. He believes that work never hurts, but the play does.

Nobody, he thinks, can work enough to hurt him.

He thinks that marriage and love interfere with success.

He does not believe in telepathy, which is, according to its exponents, a sort of psychical electricity enabling one mind to communicate ideas to another without words. He considers that what is usually taken as an evidence of the existence of telepathy is mere coincidence, that the working of the human mind through observation and reason interests and amazes him, as it well may.

One wise man whom I knew used to say that the scientists with their jumble of laws governing the universe were ignoramuses, and that there weren’t more than half a dozen fundamental laws all told. I asked Mr. Tesla what he thought about that.

'''I think,” said he, “that they could all be reduced to one.’’’

                           by⠀
                    New York Times, The
               March 14th, 1895 Page number(s):

'''I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say? The work of half my lifetime, very nearly all my mechanical instruments and scientific apparatus, that it has taken years to perfect, swept away in a fire that lasted only an hour or two. How can I estimate the loss in mere dollars and cents? Everything is gone. I must begin over again.’’’

That is all that Nikola Tesla, the renowned electrician, had to say about a fire that utterly wiped out his laboratory at 35 South Fifth Avenue yesterday and destroyed instruments on which he has made experiments in advanced electricity that have astonished the world. Tears were in his eyes when he spoke.

Fig.
Nicola[sic] Tesla, Whose Electric Works Were Burned Yesterday.

Ever since Mr. Tesla came to this country from Servia, about ten years ago, and became for a time associated with Mr. Edison in his laboratory, at Menlo Park, N. J., his experiments have been watched with increasing solicitude by almost everybody interested in the progress of electrical science. He has attracted almost as much attention as “Wizard” Edison himself. The two men are scarcely rivals, for they conducted their investigations on substantially different lines. Personally, they are warm friends. Mr. Tesla never cared to talk much about his work. Few people knew what was going on in the rooms that were destroyed by fire yesterday. About fifteen men were at work there nearly every day, experimenting under Tesla’s personal direction. He worked as hard as his men did. He had a little office with a roll-top desk and a rug but he seldom went near it except to talk to visitors. Most of his workaday hours were spent bustling about in his shirt sleeves among his instruments.

Outside his shop he is something of a Sybarite. He dines at Delmonico’s almost invariably, and lounges about the café during the evening. Habitués of the place know him well. He is very tall and very thin. His dark[sic] eyes are perhaps his most noticeable feature. They are large and brilliant, showing with the zeal of an enthusiast.

Lectures given by Mr. Tesla from time to time give the best idea of his hopes and aims. Of course, he does a great deal of practical work all the time, aside from his experiments. He is controlling engineer of the Niagara Power Company and consulting engineer to other corporations interested in electrical supply. But his experiments took up most of his time. One thing that Mr. Tesla was striving to accomplish was to prevent the enormous waste of force in the manufacture of electricity. He has contended that about 99 per cent. of the energy now goes to waste. His experiments have been devoted to saving at least one-third of the energy, which would make it possible to obtain a much greater illumination that can be procured at present, and at a great decrease in cost.

'''The ideal way of lighting a room would be,’’’ he said in one of his lectures before a scientific society two years ago, '''to produce such a condition in it that an illuminating device could be moved and put anywhere, and that it should be lighted no matter where put, without being electrically connected with anything.’’’

Tesla has demonstrated in his experiments that the polyphase currents of high potency, even to 250,000 volts, have no hurtful effect on the human body. He allowed that number of volts to pass through his own body without harm. Through his discovery of the means of transmitting electricity without a wire, Mr. Tesla expected to produce a light as powerful as sunshine as soon as he had discovered how to care safely for the 8,000,000 volts necessary for the purpose.

Gillis & Geoghegan, manufacturers of steamfitters’ supplies, occupied the lower floors of the building in which Mr. Tesla had his laboratory. Night Watchman Mahoney was employed to look after the building. He said that he was making his rounds as usual just before 3 o’clock yesterday morning when he discovered the fire. It had started on the ground floor, but from precisely what cause is not known. He tried in vain to put it out with pails of water.

The building was saturated with oils necessary in the manufacture of fittings, and it burned like a tinder-box. Before a line of hose could be put down it was evident that the place was doomed. Chief Bonner and his men could make little headway against the terrific heat. It was so intense that at one time the elevated railway structure caught fire. There was a box factory next door, filled with inflammable material, and every endeavor was made to keep that from going, too. It took three hours to get the flames under control. There are so many ramshackle buildings in that locality that if the box factory had once caught fire there is no telling where the fire would have ended.

Mr. Tesla’s employes were dismayed when they appeared on the scene for work in the morning and found their occupation gone. Not one of them had the courage to go and tell their employer of his terrible loss. He appeared, as usual, about 10 o’clock, and found it out for himself. At first he was simply dazed.

'''It cannot be true!’’’ he explained, pacing up and down before the ruins in hopeless despair. He told a fireman that he had no insurance, and that, so far as he knew, the money loss would probably represent $50,000. The loss to the building itself is estimated at $25,000, and the loss to Gillis & Geoghegan is estimated at $80,000. This is covered by insurance.

   A Way to Harness Free Electric Currents
        Discovered by Nikola Tesla.

                   by⠀
         The World Sunday Magazine
      March 8th, 1896 Page number(s): ?

The World is on the eve of an astounding revelation. The conditions under which we exist will be changed. The end has come to telegraph and telephone monopolies with a crash. Incidentally, all the other monopolies that depend on power of any kind will come to a sudden stop. The earth currents of electricity are to be harnessed. Nature supplies them free of charge. The cost of power and light and heat will be practically nothing.

The scientist-electricians who have for years been trying to master the mystery of electrical earth currents with which the ground beneath your feet is filled, are on the threshold of success. The success of the experiments they have under way means much to them, but vastly more to the people. It means that if Nikola Tesla succeeds in harnessing the electrical earth currents and putting them to work for man there will be an end to oppressive, extortionate monopolies in steam, telephone, telegraphs and the other commercial uses of electricity, and that the grasping millionaires who have for two decades milked the people's purse with electrical fingers will have to relinquish their monopoly.

Nikola Tesla has discovered the secret of the electric earth currents of nature, and they will be adapted to the use of man. He has succeeded in transmitting sound by the currents that make an electric riot of the earth. The transmission of power will follow. His experiments reduced to commercially practicable uses will be able to tap the electric currents of the earth and make them serve the purposes of industry and of trade just as a well digger over on Long Island taps water or a Pennsylvania miner opens a vein of coal. The mighty electrical energy that has been stored up in the earth for ages will be harnessed and made to move the machinery of men.

Electricity will be as free as the air. For the privilege of its use legislatures will not have to be bribed or men corrupted at the polls, and public boards will not have to be "seen" to bestow exclusive franchises upon corporations organized to use public property for purposes of private gain, and make the people pay the original cost of their investment and excessive charges for service in order to squeeze dividends out of copiously watered shares.

Monopolies for purveying steam power too will be forced to capitulate to free electricity, for with the latter manufactures will only have to connect their dynamos with the earth currents to set their machinery in motion. The successful adaptation of Tesla's discovery will administer a death-blow to the most galling slavery that has ever yoked the activities of men to the treadmill of monopoly. Tesla is the wizard who is going to emancipate modern industries from the shackles of corrupting, dividend-grabbing, monopolistic corporations.

Sound travels with amazing speed, but electrical vibrations travel so swiftly that it is difficult to conjure up a figure which will graphically illustrate their speed. Here is one that will perhaps convey a vivid and lucid impression. In fancy place yourself at a table with a revolver in one hand and a finger of the other hand on the key of a telegraph instrument connected with a wire that girdles the globe seven times and laps over on the eighth turn a distance equal to 11,000 miles. Pull the trigger of the pistol and simultaneously press the telegraph key. While the sound of the report of the revolver is traveling 1,250 feet the electrical impulse imparted by the pressure on the key will pass seven and a half times around the world through the wire with which the key is connected.

Sound travels 1,250 feet a second and electrical impulse 186,000 miles a second. If the electrical currents with which the earth is filled can be harnessed and put to work a new era in electricity will have dawned. It is to the mastering of the mystery of these earth currents and their adaptation that scientist like Tesla have been striving.

In the course of Tesla's experiments it is reported he found that in the vicinity of large cities there were so many conflicting earth currents that satisfactory results could not be obtained. So he went out to Denver and near there found a better field for experimenting. There he met a friend interested in electrical research.  They went to Pike's Peak. Conspicuous among their baggage were two autoharps.

Tesla and his friend scaled the rugged sides of the peak. At an elevation agreed upon they separated. Tesla skirted the peak and on reaching a point precisely opposite the place at which he left his friend he stopped. The two experimenters, on a line drawn straight through the peak, were thus separated by four miles of stratified rock. The two autoharps had been very delicately attuned before the scientists parted, and a time fixed for Mr. Tesla's comrade to play an air (also agreed upon) on the autoharp.

Tesla waited patiently the arrival of the appointed time. Then he connected his harp with the ground in such a way as to secure harmonic resonance with the earth current. The manner and medium of this connection are secrets. The receiving autoharp was equipped with a microphone. As the time approached for his friend on the other side of the peak to strum the appointed tune Tesla listened with rapt attention.

At last, as a tuning-fork responds to its harmonic note sounded on the strings of a piano, the autoharp in Mr. Tesla's hands gave out the harmonic tunes of "Ben Bolt" which his companion at his station four miles away straight through the peak was plucking from the tense wires of his instrument. The experiment was a success. After many tunes had been played Tesla and his companion descended the peak. A statement of the facts and results of the experiment was written and attested before a notary public as a matter of scientific record.

The electric currents are in the earth. Their strength is great enough to furnish all the power and light man needs. Mr. Tesla has overcome the initial difficulty, and has located and tapped the earth's currents. The rest will follow, as followed the telephone, Prof. Bell's discovery of how to transmit speech over a wire.

📰🧙📰 TESLA'S STARTLING RESULTS IN RADIOGRAPHY AT GREAT DISTANCES 📰🧙📰

TESLA ON ROENTGEN RAYS
                  ———
A Highly Interesting and Valuable Communication from the Talented Young Inventor.
                  ———
'''To the Editor of Electrical Review:

One can not help looking at that little bulb of Crookes’ with a feeling akin to awe, when he considers all that it has done for scientific progress—first, the magnificent results obtained by its originator; next, the brilliant work of Lenard, and finally the wonderful achievements of Roentgen. Possibly it may still contain a grateful Asmodeus, who will be lot out of his narrow prison cell by a lucky student. At times it has seemed to me as though I myself heard a whispering voice, and I have searched eagerly among my dusty bulbs and bottles. I fear my imagination has deceived me, but there they are still, my dusty bulbs, and I am still listening hopefully.

After repeating Professor Roentgen’s beautiful experiments, I have devoted my energies to the investigation of the nature of the radiations and to the perfecting of the means for their production. The following is a brief statement which, I hope, will be useful, of the methods employed and of the most notable results arrived at in these two directions.

Fig. 2 
Fig. 2.—Tesla's respects to Prof. Roentgen - A Radiograph of a wire sign taken through a wooden cover at the remarkable distance of eleven feet, with one-half hour's exposure.

In order to produce the most intense effects we have first to consider that, whatever their nature, they depend necessarily on the intensity of the cathode streams. These again being dependent on the magnitude of the potential, it follows that the highest attainable electrical pressure is desirable.

To obtain high potentials we may avail ourselves of an ordinary induction coil, or of a static machine, or of a disruptive discharge coil. I have the impression that most of the results in Europe have been arrived at through the employment of a static machine or Ruhmkorff coil. But since these appliances can produce only a comparatively small potential, we are naturally thrown on the use of the disruptive discharge coil as the most effective apparatus. With this there is practically no limit to the spark length, and the only requirement is that the experimenter should possess a certain knowledge and skill in the adjustments of the circuits, particularly as to resonance, as I have pointed out in my earlier writings on this subject.

After constructing a disruptive coil suitable for any kind of current supply, direct or alternating the experimenter comes to the consideration as to what kind of bulb to employ. Clearly, if we put two electrodes in a bulb, or use one inside and another outside electrode, we limit the potential, for the presence not only of the anode but of any conducting object has the effect of reducing the practicable potential on the cathode. Thus, to secure the result aimed at, one is driven to the acceptance of a single electrode bulb; the other terminal being as far remote as possible.

Obviously, an inside electrode should be employed to get the highest velocity of the cathode streams, for the bulbs without inside terminals'''...

     TESLA'S RADIOGRAPHS
We publish a welcome addition to
the Roentgen ray literature. It is
from the always interesting pen of
Nikola Tesla, and is the first author-
ized description of the experiments
of this through and conscientious
inventor. Mr. Tesla gives full credit
to the discovery by Roentgen,
and is personally much elated over
discoveries of his own as his careful
experiments are developed. The
Tesla radiographs we present show
wonderful results under severe con-
ditions. While Tesla has heretofore
been silent since the announcement
by Roentgen, he has not been idle,
but has evidently been striving for
valuable and tangible results. Fur-
ther information from his laboratory
will be awaited with interest.

...'''are much less efficient for this special object in consequence of the loss through the glass. A popular error seems to exist in regard to the concentration of the rays by concave electrodes. This, if anything, is a disadvantage. There are certain specific arrangements of the disruptive coil and circuits, condensers and static screens for the bulb, on which I have given full particulars on previous occasions.

Having selected the induction apparatus and type of bulb, the next important consideration is the vacuum. On this subject I am able to make known a fact with which I have long been acquainted, and of which I have taken advantage in the production of vacuum jackets and all sorts of incandescent bulbs, and which I subsequently found to be of the utmost importance, not to say essential, for the production of intense Roentgen shadows. I refer to a method of rarefaction by electrical means to any degree desirable far beyond that obtainable by mechanical appliances.

Though this result can be reached by the use of a static machine as, well as of an ordinary induction coil giving a sufficiently high potential, I have found that by far the most suitable apparatus, and one which secures the quickest action, is a disruptive coil. It is best to proceed in this way: The bulb is first exhausted by means of an ordinary vacuum pump to a rather high degree, though my experiences have shown that this is not absolutely necessary, as I have also found it possible to rarefy, beginning from low pressure. After being taken down from the pump, the bulb is attached to the terminal of the disruptive coil, preferably of high frequency of vibration, and usually the following phenomena are noted. First, there is a milky light spreading through the bulb, or possibly for a moment the glass becomes phosphorescent, if the bulb has been exhausted to a high degree. At any rate, the phosphorescence generally subsides quickly and the white light settles around the electrode, whereupon a dark space forms at some distance from the latter. Shortly afterward the light assumes a reddish color and the terminal grows very hot. This heating, however, is observed only with powerful apparatus. It is well to watch the bulb carefully and regulate the potential at this stage, as the electrode might be quickly consumed.

After some time the reddish light subsides, the streams becoming again white, whereupon they get weaker and weaker, wavering around the electrode until they finally disappear. Meanwhile, the phosphorescence of the glass grows more and more intense, and the spot where the stream strikes the wall becomes very hot, while the phosphorescence around the electrode ceases and the latter cools down to such an extent that the glass near it may be actually ice 🐇 cold to the touch. The gas in the'''...

...'''bulb has then reached the required degree of rarefaction. The process may be hastened by repeated heating arid cooling and by the employment of a small electrode. It should be added that bulbs with external electrodes, may be treated in the same way. It may be also of interest to state that under certain conditions, which I am investigating more closely, the pressure of the gas in a vessel may be augmented by electrical means.

I believe that the disintegration of the electrode, which invariably takes place, is connected with a notable diminution of the temperature. From the point on, when the electrode gets cool, the bulb is in a very good condition for producing the Roentgen shadows. Whenever the electrode is equally, if not hotter than the glass, it is a sure indication that the vacuum is not high enough, or else that the electrode is too small. For very effective working, the inside surface of the wall, where the cathode stream strikes, should appear as if the glass were in a fluid state.

As a cooling medium I have found best to employ jets of cold air. By this means it is possible to operate successfully a bulb with a very thin wall, while the passage of the rays is not materially impeded.

I may state here that the experimenter need not be deterred from using a glass bulb, as I believe the opacity of glass as well as the transparency of aluminum are somewhat exaggerated, inasmuch as I have found that a very thin aluminum sheet throws a marked shadow, while, on the other hand, I have obtained impressions through a thick glass plate.

The above method is valuable not only as a means of obtaining the high vacua desired, but it is still more important, because the phenomena observed throw a light on the results obtained by Lenard and Roentgen.

Though the phenomenon of rarefaction under above conditions admits of different interpretations, the chief interest centers on one of them, to which I adhere—that is, on the actual expulsion of the particles through the walls of the bulb. I have lately observed that the latter commences to act properly upon the sensitive plate only from the point when the exhaustion begins to be noticeable, and the effects produced are the strongest when the process of exhaustion is most rapid, even though the phosphorescence might not appear particularly bright. Evidently, then, the two effects are closely connected, and I am getting more and more convinced that we have to deal with a stream of material particles, which strike the sensitive plate with great velocities. Taking as a basis the estimate of Lord Kelvin on the speed of projected ‘particles in a Crookes’ bulb, we arrive easily by the employment of very high potentials to speeds of as much as a hundred kilometers a second. Now, again, the old question arises: Are the particles from the electrode, or from the charged surface generally, including the case of an external electrode, projected through the glass or aluminum walls, or do they merely hit the inner surface and cause particles from the outside of the wall to fly off, acting in a purely mechanical way, as when a row of ivory balls is struck? 🐇 So far, most of the phenomena indicate that they are projected through the wall of the bulb, of whatever material it may be, and I am seeking for still more conclusive evidence in this direction.

It may not be known that even an ordinary streamer, breaking out suddenly and under great pressure from the terminal of a disruptive coil, passes through a thick glass plate as though the latter were not present. Unquestionably, with such coils pressures are practicable which will project the particles in straight lines even under atmospheric pressure. I have obtained distinct impressions in free air, not by streamers, as some experimenters have done, using static machines or induction coils, but by actual projection, the formation of streamers being absolutely prevented by careful static screening.

A peculiar thing about the Roentgen rays is that from low frequency to the highest obtainable there seems to be no difference in the quality of the effects produced, except that they are more intense when the frequency is higher, which is very likely due to the fact that in such case the maximum pressures on the cathode are likewise higher. This is only possible on the assumption that the effects on the sensitive plate are due to projected particles, or else to vibrations far beyond any frequency which we are able to obtain by means of condenser discharges. A powerfully excited bulb is enveloped in a cloud of violet light, extending for more than a foot around it, but outside of this visible phenomenon there is no positive evidence of the existence of waves similar to those of light. On the other hand, the fact that the opacity bears some proportion to the density of the substance speaks strongly for material streams, and the same may be said of the effect discovered by Prof. J. J. Thomson. It is to be hoped that all doubts will shortly be dispelled.

A valuable evidence of the nature of the radiations and progress in the direction of obtaining strong impressions on the plate might be arrived at by perfecting plates especially sensitive to mechanical shock or impact. There are chemicals suitable for this, and the development in this direction may lead to the abandonment of the present plate. Furthermore, if we have to deal with streams of material particles, it seems not impossible to project upon the plate a suitable substance to insure the best chemical action.

With apparatus as I have described, remarkable impressions on the plate are produced. An idea of the intensity of the effects may be gained when I mention that it is easy to obtain shadows with comparatively short exposures at distances of many feet, while at small distances and with thin objects, exposures of a few seconds are practicable. The annexed print is a shadow of a copper wire projected at a distance of 11 feet through a wooden cover over the sensitive plate. This was the first shadow taken with my improved apparatus in my laboratory. A similar impression was obtained through the body of the experimenter, a plate of glass, nearly three-sixteenths of an inch thick, a thickness of wood of fully two inches and through a distance of about four feet. I may remark, however, that when these impressions were taken, my apparatus was working under extremely unfavorable conditions, which admitted of so great improvements that I am hopeful to magnify the effects many times.

The bony structure of birds, rabbits and the like is shown within the least detail, and even the hollow of the bones is clearly visible. In a plate of a rabbit under exposure of an hour, not only every detail of the skeleton is visible, but likewise a clear outline of the abdominal cavity and the location of the lungs, the fur and many other features. Prints of even large birds show the feathers quite distinctly.

Clear shadows of the bones of human limbs are obtained by exposures ranging from a quarter of an hour to an hour, and some plates have shown such an amount of detail that it is almost impossible to believe that we have to deal with shadows only. For instance, a picture of a foot with a shoe on it was taken, and every fold of the leather, trousers, stocking, etc., is visible, while the flesh and bones stand out sharply. Through the body of the experimenter the shadows of small buttons and like objects are quickly obtained, while with an exposure of from one to one and a half hour the ribs, shoulder-bones and the bones of the upper arm appear dearly, as is shown in the annexed print. It is now demonstrated beyond any doubt that small metallic objects or bony or chalky deposits can be infallibly detected in any part of the body.

An outline of the skull is easily obtained with an exposure of 20 to 40 minutes. In one instance an exposure of 40 minutes gave dearly not only the outline, but the cavity of the eye, the chin and cheek and nasal bones, the lower jaw and connections to the upper one, the vertebral column and connections to the skull, the flesh and even the hair. By exposing the head to a powerful radiation strange effects have been noted. For instance, I find that there is a tendency to sleep and the time seems to pass away quickly. There is a general soothing effect, and I have felt a sensation of warmth in the upper part of the head. An assistant independently confirmed the tendency to sleep and a quick lapse of time. Should these remarkable effects be verified by men with keener sense of observation, I shall still more firmly believe in the existence of material streams penetrating the skull. Thus it may be possible by these strange appliances to project a suitable chemical into any part of the body.

Roentgen advanced modestly his results, warning against too much hope. Fortunately his apprehensions were groundless, for, although we have to all appearance to deal with mere shadow projections, the possibilities of the application of his discovery are vast. I am happy to have contributed to the development of the great art he has created.

                                        The announcement of Nikola Tesla’s
                                        achievements in the new art, first
                                        published in the ELECTRICAL REVIEW
                                        of March 11, in the author’s own
                                        modest language, has added fresh
                                        impetus to the work in this direction.
                                        His disruptive discharge coil has been
                                        universally used where the best re-

                                        promise great results. Other impor-

                                        which the radiographs have been
                                        made, and brief time of exposure.
                                           We feel sure that the second com-

                                        we publish in this issue, will be
                                        appreciated by our readers. He now
                                        produces shadows at 40 feet distance
                                        and promises still more. He further-
                                        more, brings out the important fact
                                        of reflection of the rays, demon-
                                        starting this property beyond any

                                        presented will appear as a revelation.
                                           The pleasant criticism of our half-

                                        justified, but any one who knows the
                                        difficulties of the procedure involved
                                        will be convinced that as much was
                                        done as could be done under the cir-
                                        cumstances.
                                           Mr. Tesla is pursuing quietly his
                                        work and giving all credit to Roent-
                                        gen ; and it is significant, we think,
                                        that the first radiograph he produced
                                        in his laboratory was the name of the
                                        discoverer. We wish that such cour-

                                        be practiced.

   Vol. XXVIII - Jan 1 to Jun 24 - No. 12

'''TO THE EDITOR OF ELECTRICAL REVIEW:
 Permit me to say that I was slightly disappointed to note in your issue of Mar. 11 the prominence you have deemed to accord to my youth and talent, while the ribs and other particulars of Fig. 1, which, with reference to the print accompanying my communication, I described as clearly visible, were kept modestly in the background. I also regretted to observe an error in one of the captions, the more so, as I must ascribe it to my own text. I namely stated on page 135, third column, seventh line: '''A similar impression was obtained through the body of the experimenter, etc., through a distance of four feet.’’’

The impression here referred to was a similar one to that shown in Fig. 2, whereas the shadow in Fig. 1 was taken through a distance of 18 inches. I state this merely for the sake of correctness of my communication, but, as far as the general truth of the fact of taking such a shadow at the distance given is concerned, your caption might as well stand, for I am producing strong shadows at distances of 40 feet. I repeat, 40 feet and even more.

Nor is this all. So strong are the actions on the film that provisions must be made to guard the plates in my photographic department, located on the floor above, a distance of fully 60 feet, from being spoiled by long exposure to the stray rays. Though during my investigations I have performed many experiments, which seemed extraordinary, I am deeply astonished observing these unexpected manifestations, and still more so, as even now I see before me the possibility, not to say certi­tude, of augmenting the effects with my apparatus at least tenfold! What may we then expect? We have to deal here, evidently, with a radiation of astonishing pow­er, and the inquiry into its nature becomes more and more interesting and important.

Here is an unlooked—for result of an action, which though wonderful in itself, seemed feeble and entirely incapable of such expansion, and affords a good example of the fruitfulness of original discovery. These effects upon the sensitive plate at so great a distance I attribute to the employment of a bulb with a single terminal, which permits the use of practically any desired potential and the attainment of extraordinary speeds of the projected particles. With such a bulb it is also evident that the action upon a fluorescent screen is proportionately greater than when the usual kind of tube is employed, and I have already observed enough to feel sure that great developments are to be looked for in this direction. I consider Roentgen’s discovery, of enabling us to see, by the use of a fluorescent screen, through an opaque substance, even a more beautiful one than the recording upon the plate.

Since my previous communication to you I have made considerable progress, and can presently announce one more result of importance. I have lately obtained shadows by reflected rays only, thus demonstrating beyond doubt that the Roentgen rays possess this property. One of the experiments may be cited here. A thick copper tube, about a foot long, was taken and one of its ends tightly closed by the plateholder containing a sensitive plate, protected by a fiber cover as usual. Near the open end of the copper tube was placed a thick plate of glass at an angle of 45 degrees to the axis of the tube.

A single terminal bulb was then suspended above the glass plate at a distance of about eight inches, so that the bundle of rays fell upon the latter at an angle of 45 degrees, and the supposedly reflected rays passed along the axis of the copper tube. An exposure of 45 minutes gave a clear and sharp shadow of a metallic object. This shadow was produced by the reflected rays, as the direct action was absolutely excluded, it having been demonstrated that even under the severest tests with much stronger actions no impression whatever could be produced upon the film through a thickness of copper equal to that of the tube. Concluding from the intensity of the action by comparison with an equivalent effect due to the direct rays, I find that approximately two per cent of the latter were reflected from the glass plate in this experiment. I hope to be able to report shortly and more fully on this and other subjects.

In my attempts to contribute my humble share to the knowledge of the Roentgen phenomena, I am finding more and more evidence in support of the theory of moving material particles. It is not my intention, however, to advance at present any view as to the bearing of such a fact upon the present theory of light, but I merely seek to establish the fact of the existence of such material streams in so far as these isolated effects are concerned. I have already a great many indications of a bombardment occurring outside of the bulb, and I am arranging some crucial tests which, I hope, will be successful.

The calculated velocities fully account for actions at distances of as much as 100 feet from the bulb, and that the projection through the glass takes place seems evident from the process of exhaustion, which I have described in my previous communication. An experiment which is illustrative in this respect, and which I intended to mention, is the following; If we attach a fairly exhausted bulb containing an electrode to the terminal of a disruptive coil, we observe small streamers breaking through the side of the glass.

Usually such a streamer will break through the seal and crack the bulb, whereupon the vacuum is impaired; but, if the seal is placed above the terminal, or if some other provision is made to prevent the streamer from passing through the glass at that point, it often occurs that the stream breaks out through the side of the bulb, producing a fine hole. Now, the extraordinary thing is that, in spite of the connection to the outer atmosphere, the air cannot rush into the bulb as long as the hole is very small. The glass at the place where the rupture has occurred may grow very hot — to such a degree as to soften; but it will not collapse, but rather bulge out, showing that a pressure from the inside greater than that of the atmosphere exists.

On frequent occasions I have observed that the glass bulges out and the hole, through which the streamer rushes out, becomes so large as to be perfectly discernible to the eye. As the matter is expelled from the bulb the rarefaction increases and the streamer becomes less and less intense, whereupon the glass closes again, hermetically sealing the opening. The process of rarefaction, nevertheless, continues, streamers being still visible on the heated place until the highest degree of exhaustion is reached, whereupon they may disappear. Here, then, we have a positive evidence that matter is being expelled through the walls of the glass.

When working with highly strained bulbs I frequently experience a sudden, and sometimes even painful, shock in the eye. Such shocks may occur so often that the eye gets inflamed, and one cannot be considered over cautious if he abstains from watching the bulb too closely. I see in these shocks a further evidence of larger particles being thrown off from the bulb.

Nicola[sic] Tesla, the electrician and scientist, has had in course of development for some time a project for instantaneous and simultaneous communication to all parts of the earth, and perhaps to some of the nearer planets. Mr. Tesla's plan does not deal with fireworks, or the illumination of a large part of the earth's surface in hope of attracting the attention of the dwellers on Mars, but deals wholly with the electric waves. In regard to it, Mr. Tesla said yesterday to a Sun reporter:

'''I have had this scheme under consideration for five or six years, and I am becoming more convinced every day that it is based upon scientific principles and is thoroughly practicable. We know that electric disturbances on the sun are productive of similar disturbances on the earth in the form of thunder showers. Now, why is it not equally conceivable that a disturbance on the earth's surface should produce some tangible effect on other planets. The transmission of disturbances on the sun shows beyond doubt that waves of electricity are propagated through all space.

'''The objection may be put forward that sufficient electrical disturbance cannot be made on the earth's surface, and that we should be wholly dependent upon thunder stores and other phenomena of nature for the success of our experiment. But, on the contrary, we can make all the artificial thunder and lightning we want. There is no difficulty in making electric apparatus with a spark gap of a mile, and if that did not prove effective it could be increased.

'''Do not get the impression,''' continued Mr. Tesla, '''that the success of the experiment is in any way dependent upon the light, noise, or vibration accompanying such an electric discharge. It is wholly through the electricity waves, which are propagated through the atmosphere and the ether beyond, that we may hope to obtain any results. But if there are intelligent inhabitants of Mars or any other planet, it seems to me that we can do something to attract their attention.

'''This, of course, is the extreme application of this principle of the propagation of electric waves. The same principle may be employed with good effect for the transmission of news to all parts of the earth. It was formerly thought that in order to get any power out of electricity a conducting circuit must exist, but it has been shown that the same results may be accomplished with a single wire. It is perfectly possible to operate a motor or electric light with just a single line of wire leading to the apparatus. It naturally occurred to me that, as the earth is a conductor, an electrical disturbance at one point, causing a change in the equilibrium of the earth's electricity, should be felt at all points on the earth's surface, and might be recorded by properly constructed instruments.

'''The possibilities of such a transmission of intelligence cannot be exaggerated. Every city on the globe could be on an immense ticker circuit, and a message sent from New York would be in England, Africa, and Australia in an instant. What a grand thing it would be in times of war, epidemic, or panic in the money market!'''

Mr. Tesla is at present engaged in finishing his calculations and perfecting the apparatus necessary for experiment in his new field of investigation, and he hopes soon to be able to show practicability of his plan.

'''To the Editor of Electrical Review:

Further investigations concerning the behavior of the various metals in regard to reflection of these radiations have given additional support to the opinion which I have before expressed; namely, that Volta’s electric contact series in air is identical with that which is obtained when arranging the metals according to their powers of reflection, the most electro-positive metal being the best reflector. Confining myself to the metals easily experimented upon, this series is magnesium, lead, tin, iron, copper, silver, gold and platinum. The last-named metal should be found to be the poorest, and sodium one of the best, reflectors. This relation is rendered still more interesting and suggestive when we consider that this series is approximately the same which is obtained when arranging the metals according to their energies of combination with oxygen, as calculated from their chemical equivalents.

Should the above relation be confirmed by other physicists, we shall be justified to draw the following conclusions: First, the highly exhausted bulb emits material streams which, impinging on a metallic surface, are reflected; second, these streams are formed of matter in some primary or elementary condition; third, these material streams are probably the same agent which is the cause of the electro-motive tension between metals in close proximity or actual contact, and they may possibly, to some extent, determine the energy of combination of the metals with oxygen; fourth, every metal or conductor is more or less a source of such streams; fifth, these streams or radiations must be produced by some radiations which exist in the medium; and sixth, streams resembling the cathodic must be emitted by the sun and probably also by other sources of radiant energy, such as an arc light or Bunsen burner.

The first of these conclusions, assuming the above-cited fact to be correct, is evident and uncontrovertible. No theory of vibration of any kind would account for this singular relation between the powers of reflection and electric properties of the metals. Streams of projected matter coming in actual contact with the reflecting metal surface afford the only plausible explanation.

The second conclusion is likewise obvious, since no difference whatever is observed by employing various qualities of glass for the bulb, electrodes of different metals and any kind of residual gases. Evidently, whatever the matter constituting the streams may be, it must undergo a change in the process of expulsion, or, generally speaking, projection — since the views in this regard still differ — in such a way as to lose entirely the characteristics which it possessed when forming the electrode, or wall of the bulb, or the gaseous contents of the latter.

The existence of the above relation between the reflecting and contact series forces us likewise to the third conclusion, because a mere coincidence of that kind is, to say the least, extremely improbable. Besides, the fact may be cited that there is always a difference of potential set up between two metal plates at some distance and in the path of the rays issuing from an exhausted bulb.

Now, since there exists an electric pressure of difference of potential between two metals in close proximity or contact, we must, when considering all the foregoing, come to the fourth conclusion, namely, that the metals emit similar streams, and I therefore anticipate that, if a sensitive film be placed between two plates, say, of magnesium and copper, a true Roentgen shadow picture would be obtained after a very long exposure in the dark. Or, in general, such picture could be secured whenever the plate is placed near a metallic or conducting body, leaving for the present the insulators out of consideration. Sodium, one of the first of the electric contact series, but not yet experimented upon, should give out more of such streams than even magnesium.

Obviously, such streams could not be forever emitted, unless there is a continuous supply of radiation from the medium in some other form; or possibly the streams which the bodies themselves emit are merely reflected streams coming from other sources. But since all investigation has strengthened the opinion advanced by Roentgen that for the production of these radiations some impact is required, the former of the two possibilities is the more probable one, and we must assume that the radiations existing in the medium and giving rise to those here considered partake something of the nature of cathodic streams.

But if such streams exist all around us in the ambient medium, the question arises, whence do they come? The only answer is: From the sun. I infer, therefore, that the sun and other sources of radiant energy must, in a less degree, emit radiations or streams of matter similar to those thrown off by an electrode in a highly exhausted inclosure. This seems to be, at this moment, still a point of controversy. According to my present convictions a Roentgen shadow picture should, with very long exposures, be obtained from all sources of radiant energy, provided the radiations are permitted first to impinge upon a metal or other body.

The preceding considerations tend to show that the lumps of matter composing a cathodic stream in the bulb are broken up into incomparably smaller particles by impact against the wall of the latter, and, owing to this, are enabled to pass into the air. All evidence which I have so far obtained points rather to this than to the throwing off of particles of the wall itself under the violent impact of the cathodic stream. According to my convictions, then, the difference between Lenard and Roentgen rays, if there be any, lies solely in this, that the particles composing the latter are incomparably smaller and possess a higher velocity. To these two qualifications I chiefly attribute the non-deflectibility by a magnet which I believe will be disproved in the end. Both kinds of rays, however, affect the sensitive plate and fluorescent screen, only the rays discovered by Roentgen are much more effective. We know now that these rays are produced under certain exceptional conditions in a bulb, the vacuum being extremely high, and that the range of greatest activity is rather small.

I have endeavored to find whether the reflected rays possess certain distinctive features, and I have taken pictures of various objects with this purpose in view, but no marked difference was noted in any case. I therefore conclude that the matter composing the Roentgen rays does not suffer further degradation by impact against bodies. One of the most important tasks for the experimenter remains still to determine what becomes of the energy of these rays. In a number of experiments with rays reflected from and transmitted through a conducting of insulating plate, I found that only a small part of the rays could be accounted for. For instance, through a zinc plate, one-sixteenth of an inch thick, under an incident angle of 45 degrees, about two and one-half per cent were reflected and about three per cent transmitted through the plate, hence over 94 per cent of the total radiation remain to be accounted for. All the tests which I have been able to make have confirmed Roentgen’s statement that these rays are incapable of raising the temperature of a body. To trace this lost energy and account for it in a plausible way will be equivalent to making a new discovery.

Since it is now demonstrated that all bodies reflect more or less, the diffusion through the air is easily accounted for. Observing the tendency to scatter through the air, I have been led to increase the efficiency of reflectors by providing not one, but separated successive layers for reflection, by making the reflector of thin sheets of metal, mica or other substances. The efficiency of mica as a reflector I attribute chiefly to the fact that it is composed of many superimposed layers which reflect individually. These many successive reflections are, in my opinion, also the cause of the scattering through the air.

In my communication to you of April 1, I have for the first time stated that these rays are composed of matter in a '''primary’’’ or elementary condition or state. I have chosen this mode of expression in order to avoid the use of the word '''ether,’’’ which is usually understood in the sense of the Maxwellian interpretation, which would not be in accord with my present convictions in regard to the nature of the radiations.

An observation which might be of some interest is the following: A few years ago I described on one occasion a phenomenon observed in highly exhausted bulbs. It is a brush or stream issuing from a single electrode under certain conditions, which rotates very rapidly in consequence of the action of the earth’s magnetism. Now I have recently observed this same phenomenon in several bulbs which were capable of impressing the sensitive film and fluorescent screen very strongly. As the brush is rapidly twirling around I have conjectured that perhaps also the Lenard and Roentgen streams are rotating under the action of the earth’s magnetism, and I am endeavoring to obtain an evidence of such motion by studying the action of a bulb in various positions with respect to the magnetic axis of the earth.

In so far as the vibrational character of the rays is concerned, I still hold that the vibration is merely that which is conditioned by the apparatus employed. With the ordinary induction coil we have almost exclusively to deal with a very low vibration impressed by the commutating device or brake. With the disruptive coil we usually have a very strong superimposed vibration in addition to the fundamental one, and it is easy to trace sometimes as much as the fourth octave of the fundamental vibration. But I can not reconcile myself with the idea of vibrations approximating or even exceeding those of light, and think that all these effects could be as well produced with a steady electrical pressure as from a battery, with the exclusion of all vibration which may occur, even in such instance, as has been pointed out by De La Rive. In my experiments I have tried to ascertain whether a greater difference between the shadows of the bones and flesh could be obtained by employing currents of extremely high frequency; but I have been unable to discover any such effect which would be dependent on the frequency of the currents, although the latter were varied between as wide limits as was possible. But it is a rule that the more intense the action the sharper the shadows obtained, provided that the distance is not too small. It is furthermore of the greatest importance for the clearness of the shadows that the rays should be passed through some tubular reflector, which renders them sensibly parallel.

In order then to bring out as much detail as possible on a sensitive plate, we have to proceed in precisely the same way as if we had to deal with flying bullets hitting against a wall composed of parts of different density with the problem before us of producing as large as possible a difference in the trajectories of the bullets which pass through the various parts of the wall. Manifestly, this difference will be the greater the greater the velocity of the bullets; hence, in order to bring out detail, very strong radiations are required. Proceeding on this theory I have employed exceptionally thick films and developed very slowly, and in this way clearer pictures have been obtained. The importance of slow development has been first pointed out by Professor Wright, of Yale. Of course, if Professor Henry’s suggestion of the use of a fluorescent body in contact with the sensitive film is made use of, the process is reduced to an ordinary quick photographic procedure, and the above consideration does not apply.

Fig. 1

It being desirable to produce as powerful a radiation as possible, I have continued to devote my attention to this problem and have been quite successful. First of all, there existed limitations in the vacuum tube which did not permit the applying of as high a potential as I desired; namely, when a certain high degree of exhaustion was reached a spark would form behind the electrode, which would prevent straining the tube much higher. This inconvenience I have overcome entirely by making the wire leading to the electrode very long and passing it through a narrow channel, so that the heat from the electrode could not cause the formation of such sparks. Another limitation was imposed by streamers which would break out at the end of the tube when the potential was excessive. This latter inconvenience I have overcome either by the use of a cold blast of air along the tube, as I have mentioned before, or else by immersion of the tube in oil. The oil, as it is now well known, is a means of rendering impossible the formation of streamers by the exclusion of all air. The use of the oil in connection with the production of these radiations has been early advocated in this country by Professor Trowbridge. Originally I employed a wooden box made thoroughly tight with wax and filled with oil or other liquid, in which the tube was immersed. Observing certain specific actions, I modified and improved the apparatus, and in my later investigations I have employed an arrangement as shown in the annexed cut. A bulb b, of the kind described before, with a leading-in wire and neck much longer than here shown, was inserted into a large and thick glass tube t. The tube was closed in front by a diaphragm d of pergament, and by a rubber plug P in the back. The plug was provided with two holes, into the lower one of which a glass tube t1, reaching to very nearly the end of the bulb, was inserted. Oil of some kind was made to flow through rubber tubes r r from a large reservoir R, placed on an adjustable support S, to the lower reservoir R1, the path of the oil being clearly observable from the drawing. By adjusting the difference of the level between the two reservoirs it was easy to maintain a permanent condition of working. The outer glass tube t served in part as a reflector, while at the same time it permitted the observation of the bulb b during the action. The plug P, in which the conductor c was tightly sealed, was so arranged that it could be shifted in and out of the tube t, so as to vary the thickness of the oil traversed by the rays.

I have obtained some results with this apparatus which clearly show the advantage of such disposition. For instance, at a distance of 45 feet from the end of the bulb my assistants and myself could observe clearly the fingers of the hand through a screen of tungstate of calcium, the rays traversing about two and one half inches of oil and the diaphragm d. It is practicable with such apparatus to make photographs of small objects at a distance of 40 feet, with only a few minutes exposure, by the help of Professor Henry’s method. But, even without the use of a fluorescent powder, short exposures are practicable, so that I think the use of the above method is not essential for quick procedure. I rather believe that in the practical development of this principle, if it shall be necessary, Professor Salvioni’s suggestion of a fluorescent emulsion, combined with a film, will have to be adopted. This is bound to give better results than an independent fluorescent screen, and will very much simplify the process. I may say, however, that, since my last communication, considerable improvement has been made in the screens. The manufacturers of Edison’s tungstate of calcium are now furnishing screens which give fairly clean pictures. The powder is fine and it is more uniformly distributed. I consider, also, that the employment of a softer and thicker paper than before is of advantage. It is just to remark that the tungstate of calcium has also proved to be an excellent fluorescent in the bulb. I tested its qualities for such use immediately and find it so far unexcelled. Whether it will be so for a long time remains to be seen. News reaches us that several fluorescent bodies, better than the cyanides, have been discovered abroad.

Another improvement with a view of increasing the sharpness of the shadows has been proposed to me by Mr. E. R. Hewitt. He assumed that the absence of sharpness of the outlines in the shadows on the screen was due to the spread of the fluorescence from crystal to crystal. He proposed to avoid this by using a thin aluminum plate with many parallel grooves. Acting on this suggestion, I made some experiments with wire gauze and, furthermore, with screens made of a mixture of a fluorescent with a non-fluorescent powder. I found that the general brightness of the screen was diminished, but that with a strong radiation the shadows appeared sharper. This idea might be found capable of useful application.

By the use of the above apparatus I have been enabled to examine much better than before the body by means of the fluorescent screen. Presently the vertebral column can be seen quite clearly, even in the lower part of the body. I have also clearly noted the outlines of the hip bones. Looking in the region of the heart I have been able to locate in unmistbly. The background appeared much brighter, and this difference in the intensity of the shadow and surrounding has surprised me. The ribs I could now see on a number of occasions quite distinctly, as well as the shoulder bones. Of course, there is no difficulty whatever in observing the bones of all limbs. I noted certain peculiar effects which I attribute to the oil. For instance, the rays passed through plates of metal over one-eighth of an inch thick, and in one instance I could see quite clearly the bones of my hand through sheets of copper, iron and brass of a thickness of nearly one-quarter of an inch. Through glass the rays seemed to pass with such freedom that, looking through the screen in a direction at right angles to the axis of the tube, the action was most intense, although the rays had to pass through a great thickness of glass and oil. A glass slab nearly one-half of an inch thick, held in front of the screen, hardly dimmed the fluorescence. When holding the screen in front of the tube at a distance of about three feet, the head of an assistant, thrust between the screen and the tube, cast but a feeble shadow. It appeared some times as if the bones and the flesh were equally transparent to the radiations passing through the oil. When very close to the bulb, the screen was illuminated through the body of an assistant so strongly that, when a hand was moved in, front, I could clearly note the motion of the hand through the body. In one instance I could even distinguish the bones of the arm.

Having observed the extraordinary transparence of the bones in some instances, I at first surmised that the rays might be vibrations of high pitch, and that the oil had in some way absorbed a part of them. This view, however, became untenable when I found that at a certain distance from the bulb I obtained a sharp shadow of the bones. This latter observation led me to apply usefully the screen in taking impressions on the plate. Namely, in such case it is of advantage to first determine by means of the screen the proper distance at which the object is to be placed before taking the impression. It will be found that often the image is much clearer at a greater distance. In order to avoid any error when observing with the screen, I have surrounded the box with thick metal plates, so as to prevent the fluorescence, in consequence of the radiations, reaching the screen from the sides. I believe that such an arrangement is absolutely necessary if one wishes to make correct observations.

During my study of the behavior of oils and other liquid insulators, which I am still continuing, it has occurred to me to investigate the important effect discovered by Prof. J. J. Thomson. He announced some time ago that all bodies traversed by Roentgen radiations become conductors of electricity. I applied a sensitive resonance test to the investigation of this phenomenon in a manner pointed out in my earlier writings on high frequency currents. A secondary, preferably not in very close inductive relation to the primary circuit, was connected to the latter and to the ground, and the vibration through the primary was so adjusted that true resonance took place. As the secondary had a considerable number of turns, very small bodies attached to the free terminal produced considerable variations of potential on the latter. Placing a tube in a box of wood filled with oil and attaching it to the terminal, I adjusted the vibration through the primary so that resonance took place without the bulb radiating Roentgen rays to an appreciable extent. I then changed the conditions so that the bulb became very active in the production of the rays. The oil should have now, according to Prof. J. J. Thomson’s statement, become a conductor and a very marked change in the vibration should have occurred. This was found not to be the case, so that we must see in the phenomenon discovered by J. J. Thomson only a further evidence that we have to deal here with streams of matter which, traversing the bodies, carry away electrical charges. But the bodies do not become conductors in the common acceptance of the term. The method I have followed is so delicate that a mistake is almost an impossibility.

     Vol. VIII - May to Dec - No. 3

Our sprightly contemporary, The Electrical Journal, takes issue with Mr. Nikola Tesla as to the undesirability of marriage for inventors, and after disproving his statement that few great inventions have been made by married men, proceeds as follows:
“We are great admirers of Mr. Tesla and his work. We give him credit for mighty good hurd sense. We do not think he is like the Frenchman who excused his bachelorhood on the ground that he was “one butterfly, zat fly from ze flower to ze flower and sip ze honey.” We know, too, that Mr. Tesla’s nature is a very intense one, but we have just faith enough in women – especially American women – to make Mr. Tesla a straight-out offer to find a girl for him who will not only match his intensity in all respects, but who will tax his inventive genius to the utmost-and hence encourage it – trying to explain where he was at 2 A. M. some night when she had gone to his laboratory to bring him home and found it dark, although he had told her he was going to have to “stay down town to work tonight,”. Then again, if Mr. Tesla were to have ordinary Benedict luck and half a score of little Teslas, his inventive genius would he kept up to a white heat, hustling for the wherewithal to supply their wants. Mr, Tesla knows that “necessity is the mother of invention.” Fie, Mr. Tesla, fie, we say. Get married.  You’ll get strong, be happy, sleep o’nights; and if you leave an invention or two less to posterity, you will leave a more material and fully as necessary a legacy in another shape. Besides, they try to steal inventions from a man; they don‘t steal his children, seldom his wife, and never the pleasures that a married man falls heir to.”

 👨‍🏫🧙👨‍🏫 ON ELECTRICITY 👨‍🏫🧙👨‍🏫

        by Nikola Tesla
Niagara Falls Power Banquet Speech
         Club Ellicott
       January 12th, 1897

'''I have scarcely had courage enough to address an audience on a few unavoidable occasions, and the experience of this evening, even as disconnected from the cause of our meeting, is quite novel to me. Although in those few instances, of which I have retained agreeable memory, my words have met with a generous reception, I never deceived myself, and knew quite well that my success was not due to any excellency in the rhetorical or demonstrative art. Nevertheless, my sense of duty to respond to the request with which I was honored a few days ago was strong enough to overcome my very grave apprehensions in regard to my ability of doing justice to the topic assigned to me. It is true, at times — even now, as I speak — my mind feels full of the subject, but I know that, as soon as I shall attempt expression, the fugitive conceptions will vanish, and I shall experience certain well known sensations of abandonment, chill and silence. I can see already your disappointed countenances and can read in them the painful regret of the mistake in your choice

These remarks, gentlemen, are not made with selfish desire of winning your kindness and indulgence on my shortcomings, but with the honest intention of offering you an apology for your disappointment. Nor are they made — as you might be disposed to think — in that playful spirit which, to the enjoyment of the listeners is often displayed by belated speakers. On the contrary, I am deeply earnest in my wish that I were capable of having the fire of eloquence kindled in me, that I might dwell in adequate terms on this fascinating science of electricity, on the marvelous development which electrical annals have recorded and which, as one of the speakers justly remarked, stamp this age as the Electrical Age, and particularly on the great event we are commemorating this day. Unfortunately, this my desire must remain unfulfilled, but I am hopeful that in my formless and incomplete statements, among the few ideas and facts I shall mention there may be something of interest and usefulness, something befitting this unique occasion.

Gentlemen, there are a number of features clearly discernible in, and characteristic of, human intellectual progress in more recent times — features which afford great comfort to the minds of all those who have really at heart the advancement and welfare of mankind.

First of all the inquiry, by the aid of the microscope and electrical instruments of precision, into the nature of our organs and senses, and particularly of those through which we commune directly with the outside world and through which knowledge is conveyed to our minds, has revealed their exact construction and mode of action, which is in conformity with simple and well established physical principles and laws. Hence the observations we make and the facts we ascertain by their help are real facts and observations, and our knowledge is true knowledge.


To illustrate: Our knowledge of form, for instance, is dependent upon the positive fact that light propagates in straight lines, and, owing to this, the image formed by a lens is exactly similar to the object seen. Indeed, my thoughts in such fields and directions have led me to the conclusion that most all human knowledge is based on this simple truth, since practically every idea or conception — and therefore all knowledge — presupposes visual impressions. But if light would not 🐇 propagate in accordance with the law mentioned, but in conformity with any other law which we might presently conceive, whereby not only the image might not bear any likeness to the object seen, but even the images of the same object at different times or distances might not resemble each other, then our knowledge of form would be very defective, for then we might see, for example, 🐇 a three-cornered figure as a six or twelve-cornered one.


With the clear understanding of the mechanism and mode of action of our organs, we remove all doubts as to the reality and truth of the impressions received from the outside, and thus we bar out — forever, we may hope — that unhealthy speculation and skepticism into which formerly even strong minds were apt to fall.

Let me tell you of another comforting feature. The progress in a measured time is nowadays more rapid and greater than it ever was before. This is quite in accordance with the fundamental law of motion, which commands acceleration and increase of momentum or accumulation of energy under the action of a continuously acting force and tendency, and is the more true as every advance weakens the elements tending to produce friction and retardation. For, after all, what is progress, or — more correctly — development, or evolution, if not a movement, infinitely complex and often unscrutinizable, it is true, but nevertheless exactly determined in quantity as well as in quality of motion by the physical conditions and laws governing? This feature of more recent development is best shown in the rapid merging together of the various arts and sciences by the obliteration of the hard and fast lines of separation, of borders, some of which only a few years ago seemed unsurpassable, and which, like veritable Chinese walls, surrounded every department of inquiry and barred progress. A sense of connectedness of the various apparently widely different forces and phenomena we observe is taking possession of our minds, a sense of deeper understanding of nature as a whole, which, though not yet quite clear and defined, is keen enough to inspire us with the confidence of vast realizations in the near future.

But these features chiefly interest the scientific man, the thinker and reasoner. There is another feature which affords us still more satisfaction and enjoyment, and which is of still more universal interest, chiefly because of its bearing upon the welfare of mankind. Gentlemen, there is an influence which is getting strong and stronger day by day, which shows itself more and more in all departments of human activity, and influence most fruitful and beneficial — the influence of the artist. It was a happy day for the mass of humanity when the artist felt the desire of becoming a physician, an electrician, an engineer or mechanician or — whatnot — a mathematician or a financier; for it was he who wrought all these wonders and grandeur we are witnessing. It was he who abolished that small, pedantic, narrow-grooved school teaching which made of an aspiring student a galley-slave, and he who allowed freedom in the choice of subject of study according to one’s pleasure and inclination, and so facilitated development.


Some, who delight in the exercise of the powers of criticism, call this an asymmetrical development, a degeneration or departure from the normal, or even a degradation of the race. But they are mistaken. This is a welcome state of things, a blessing, a wise subdivision of labors, the establishment of conditions most favorable to progress. Let one concentrate all his energies in one single great effort, let him perceive a single truth, even though he be consumed by the sacred fire, then millions of less gifted men can easily follow. Therefore it is not as much quantity as quality of work which determines the magnitude of the progress.


It was the artist, too, who awakened that broad philanthropic spirit which, even in old ages, shone in the teachings of noble reformers and philosophers, that spirit which makes men in all departments and positions work not as much for any material benefit or compensation — though reason may command this also — but chiefly for the sake of success, for the pleasure there is in achieving it and for the good they might be able to do thereby to their fellow-men. Through his influence types of men are now pressing forward, impelled by a deep love for their study, men who are doing wonders in their respective branches, whose chief aim and enjoyment is the acquisition and spread of knowledge, men who look far above earthly things, whose banner is Excelsior! Gentlemen, let us honor the artist; let us thank him, let us drink his health!

Now, in all these enjoyable and elevating features which characterize modern intellectual development, electricity, the expansion of the science of electricity, has been a most potent factor. Electrical science has revealed to us the true nature of light, has provided us with innumerable appliances and instruments of precision, and has thereby vastly added to the exactness of our knowledge. Electrical science has disclosed to us the more intimate relation existing between widely different forces and phenomena and has thus led us to a more complete comprehension of Nature and its many manifestations to our senses. Electrical science, too, by its fascination, by its promises of immense realizations, of wonderful possibilities chiefly in humanitarian respects, has attracted the attention and enlisted the energies of the artist; for where is there a field in which his God-given powers would be of a greater benefit to his fellow-men than this unexplored, almost virgin, region, where, like in a silent forest, a thousand voices respond to every call?

With these comforting features, with these cheering prospects, we need not look with any feeling of incertitude or apprehension into the future. There are pessimistic men, who, with anxious faces, continuously whisper in your ear that the nations are secretly arming — arming to the teeth; that they are going to pounce upon each other at a given signal and destroy themselves; that they are all trying to outdo that victorious, great, wonderful German army, against which there is no resistance, for every German has the discipline in his very blood — every German is a soldier, But these men are in error. Look only at our recent experience with the British in that Venezuela difficulty. Two other nations might have crashed together, but not the Anglo-Saxons; they are too far ahead. The men who tell you this are ignoring forces which are continually at work, silently but resistlessly — forces which say Peace!

There is the genuine artist, who inspires us with higher and nobler sentiments, and makes us abhor strife and carnage. There is the engineer, who bridges gulfs and chasms, and facilitates contact and equalization of the heterogeneous masses of humanity. There is the mechanic, who comes with his beautiful time and energy-saving appliances, who perfects his flying machine, not to drop a bag of dynamite on a city or vessel, but to facilitate transport and travel. There, again, is the chemist, who opens new resources and makes existence more pleasant and secure; and there is the electrician, who sends his messages of peace to all parts of the globe. The time will not be long in coming when those men who are turning their ingenuity to inventing quick-firing guns, torpedoes and other implements of destruction — all the while assuring you that it is for the love and good of humanity — will find no takers for their odious tools, and will realize that, had they used their inventive talent in other directions; they might have reaped a far better reward than the sestertia received. And then, and none too soon the cry will be echoed everywhere. Brethren, stop these high-handed methods of the strong, these remnants of barbarism so inimical to progress! Give that valiant warrior opportunities for displaying a more commendable courage than that he shows when, intoxicated with victory, he rushes to the destruction of his fellow-men. Let him toil day and night with a small chance of achieving and yet be unflinching; let him challenge the dangers of exploring the heights of the air and the depths of the sea; let him brave the dread of the plague, the heat of the tropic desert and the ice of the polar region. Turn your energies to warding off the common enemies and danger, the perils that are all around you, that threaten you in the air you breathe, in the water you drink, in the food you consume. It is not strange, is it not shame, that we, beings in the highest state of development in this our world, beings with such immense powers of thought and action, we, the masters of the globe, should be absolutely at the mercy of our unseen foes, that we should not know whether a swallow of food or drink brings joy and life or pain and destruction to us! In this most modern and sensible warfare, in which the bacteriologist leads, the services electricity will render will prove invaluable. The economical production of high-frequency currents, which is now an accomplished fact, enables us to generate easily and in large quantities ozone for the disinfection of the water and the air, while certain novel radiations recently discovered give hope of finding effective remedies against ills of microbic origin, which have heretofore withstood all efforts of the physician. But let me turn to a more pleasant theme.

I have referred to the merging together of the various sciences or departments of research, and to a certain perception of intimate connection between the manifold and apparently different forces and phenomena. Already we know, chiefly through the efforts of a bold pioneer, that light, radiant heat, electrical and magnetic actions are closely related, not to say identical. The chemist professes that the effects of combination and separation of bodies he observes are due to electrical forces, and the physician and physiologist will tell you that even life’s progress is electrical. Thus electrical science has gained a universal meaning, and with right this age can claim the name “Age of Electricity.”

I wish much to tell you on this occasion — I may say I actually burn for desire of telling you — what electricity really is, but I have very strong reasons, which my coworkers will best appreciate, to follow a precedent established by a great and venerable philosopher, and I shall not dwell on this purely scientific aspect of electricity.

There is another reason for the claim which I have before stated which is even more potent than the former, and that is the immense development in all electrical branches in more recent years and its influence upon other departments of science and industry. To illustrate this influence I only need to refer to the steam or gas engine. For more than half a century the steam engine has served the innumerable wants of man. The work it was called to perform was of such variety and the conditions in each case were so different that, of necessity, a great many types of engines have resulted. In the vast majority of cases the problem put before the engineer was not as it should have been, the broad one of converting the greatest possible amount of heat energy into mechanical power, but it was rather the specific problem of obtaining the mechanical power in such form as to be best suitable for general use. As the reciprocating motion of the piston was not convenient for practical purposes, except in very few instances, the piston was connected to a crank, and thus rotating motions was obtained, which was more suitable and preferable, though it involved numerous disadvantages incident to the crude and wasteful means employed. But until quite recently there were at the disposal of the engineer, for the transformation and transmission of the motion of the piston, no better means than rigid mechanical connections. The past few years have brought forcibly to the attention of the builder the electric motor, with its ideal features. Here was a mode of transmitting mechanical motion simpler by far, and also much more economical. Had this mode been perfected earlier, there can be no doubt that, of the many different types of engine, the majority would not exist, for just as soon as an engine was coupled with an electric generator a type was produced capable of almost universal use. From this moment on there was no necessity to endeavor to perfect engines of special designs capable of doing special kinds of work. The engineer’s task became now to concentrate all his efforts upon one type, to perfect one kind of engine – the best; the universal, the engine of the immediate future; namely, the one which is best suitable for the generation of electricity. The first efforts in this direction gave a strong impetus to the development of the reciprocating high-speed engine, and also to the turbine, which latter was a type of engine of very limited practical usefulness, but became, to a certain extent, valuable in connection with the electric generator and motor. Still, even the former engine, though improved in many particulars, is not radically changed, and even now has the same objectionable features and limitations. To do away with these as much as possible, a new type of engine is being perfected in which more favorable conditions for economy are maintained, which expands the working fluid with utmost rapidity and loses little heat on the walls, an engine stripped of all usual regulating mechanism — packings, oilers and other appendages — and forming part of an electric generator; and in this type, I may say, I have implicit faith.

The gas or explosive engine has been likewise profoundly affected by the commercial introduction of electric light and power, particularly in quite recent years. The engineer is turning his energies more and more in this direction, being attracted by the prospect of obtaining a higher thermodynamic efficiency. Much larger engines are now being built, the construction is constantly improved, and a novel type of engine, best suitable for the generation of electricity, is being rapidly evolved.

There are many other lines of manufacture and industry in which the influence of electrical development has been even more powerfully felt. So, for instance, the manufacture of a great variety of articles of metal, and especially of chemical products. The welding of metals by electricity, though involving a wasteful process, has, nevertheless, been accepted as a legitimate art, while the manufacture of metal sheet, seamless tubes and the like affords promise of much improvement. We are coming gradually, but surely, to the fusion of bodies and reduction of all kinds of ores — even of iron ores — by the use of electricity, and in each of these departments great realizations are probable. Again, the economical conversion of ordinary currents of supply into high-frequency currents opens up new possibilities, such as the combination of the atmospheric nitrogen and the production of its compounds; for instance, ammonia and nitric acid, and their salts, by novel processes.

The high-frequency currents also bring us to the realization of a more economical system of lighting; namely by means of phosphorescent bulbs or tubes, and enable us to produce with these appliances light of practically any candle-power. Following other developments in purely electrical lines, we have all rejoiced in observing the rapid strides made, which, in quite recent years, have been beyond our most sanguine expectations. To enumerate the many advances recorded is a subject for the reviewer, but I can not pass without mentioning the beautiful discoveries of Lenart and Roentgen, particularly the latter, which have found such a powerful response throughout the scientific world that they have made us forget, for a time, the great achievement of Linde in Germany, who has effected the liquefaction of air on an industrial scale by a process of continuous cooling: the discovery of argon by Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay, and the splendid pioneer work of Professor Dewar in the field of low temperature research. The fact that the United States have contributed a very liberal share to this prodigious progress must afford to all of us great satisfaction. While honoring the workers in other countries and all those who, by profession or inclination, are devoting themselves to strictly scientific pursuits, we have particular reasons to mention with gratitude the names of those who have so much contributed to this marvelous development of electrical industry in this country. Bell, who, by his admirable invention enabling us to transmit speech to great distances, has profoundly affected our commercial and social relations, and even our very mode of life; Edison, who, had he not done anything else beyond his early work in incandescent lighting, would have proved himself one of the greatest benefactors of the age; Westinghouse, the founder of the commercial alternating system; Brush, the great pioneer of arc lighting; Thomson, who gave us the first practical welding machine, and who, with keen sense, contributed very materially to the development of a number of scientific and industrial branches; Weston, who once led the world in dynamo design, and now leads in the construction of electric instruments; Sprague, who, with rare energy, mastered the problem and insured the success of practical electrical railroading; Acheson, Hall, Willson and others, who are creating new and revolutionizing industries here under our very eyes at Niagara. Nor is the work of these gifted men nearly finished at this hour. Much more is still to come, for fortunately, most of them are still full of enthusiasm and vigor. All of these men and many more are untiringly at work investigating new regions and opening up unsuspected and promising fields. Weekly, if not daily, we learn through the journals of a new advance into some unexplored region, where at every step success beckons friendly, and leads the toiler on to hard and harder tasks.

But among all these many departments of research, these many branches of industry, new and old, which are being rapidly expanded, there is one dominating all others in importance — one which is of the greatest significance for the comfort and welfare, not to say for the existence, of mankind, and that is the electrical transmission of power. And in this most important of all fields, gentlemen, long afterwards, when time will have placed the events in their proper perspective, and assigned men to their deserved places, the great event we are commemorating today will stand out as designating a new and glorious epoch in the history of humanity — an epoch grander than that marked by the advent of the steam engine. We have many a monument of past ages: we have the palaces and pyramids, the temples of the Greek and the cathedrals of Christendom. In them is exemplified the power of men, the greatness of nations, the love of art and religious devotion. But that monument at Niagara has something of its own, more in accord with our present thoughts and tendencies. It is a monument worthy of our scientific age, a true monument of enlightenment and of peace. It signifies the subjugation of natural forces to the service of man, the discontinuance of barbarous methods, the relieving of millions from want and suffering. No matter what we attempt to do, no matter to what fields we turn our efforts, we are dependent on power. Our economists may propose more economical systems of administration and utilization of resources, our legislators may make wiser laws and treaties, it matters little; that kind of help can be only temporary. If we want to reduce poverty and misery, if we want to give to every deserving individual what is needed for a safe existence of an intelligent being, we want to provide more machinery, more power. Power is our mainstay, the primary source of our many-sided energies. With sufficient power at our disposal we can satisfy most of our wants and offer a guaranty for safe and comfortable existence to all, except perhaps to those who are the greatest criminals of all – the voluntarily idle.

The development and wealth of a city, the success of a nation, the progress of the whole human race, is regulated by the power available. Think of the victorious march of the British, the like of which history has never recorded. Apart from the qualities of the race, which have been of great moment, they own the conquest of the world to — coal. For with coal they produce their iron; coal furnishes them light and heat; coal drives the wheels of their immense manufacturing establishments, and coal propels their conquering fleets. But the stores are being more and more exhausted; the labor is getting dearer and dearer, and the demand is continuously increasing. It must be clear to every one that soon some new source of power supply must be opened up, or that at least the present methods must be materially improved. A great deal is expected from a more economical utilization of the stored energy of the carbon in a battery; but while the attainment of such a result would be hailed as a great achievement; it would not be as much of an advance towards the ultimate and permanent method of obtaining power as some engineers seem to believe. By reasons both of economy and convenience we are driven to the general adoption of a system of energy supply from central stations, and for such purposes the beauties of the mechanical generation of electricity can not be exaggerated. The advantages of this universally accepted method are certainly so great that the probability of replacing the engine dynamos by batteries is, in my opinion, a remote one, the more so as the high-pressure steam engine and gas engine give promise of a considerably more economical thermodynamic conversion. Even if we had this day such an economical coal battery, its introduction in central stations would by no means be assured, as its use would entail many inconveniences and drawbacks. Very likely the carbon could not be burned in its natural form as in a boiler, but would have to be specially prepared to secure uniformity in the current generation. There would be a great many cells needed to make up the electro-motive force usually required. The process of cleaning and renewal, the handling of nasty fluids and gases and the great space necessary for so many batteries would make it difficult, if not commercially unprofitable, to operate such a plant in a city or densely populated district. Again if the station be erected in the outskirts, the conversion by rotating transformers or otherwise would be a serious and unavoidable drawback. Furthermore, the regulating appliances and other accessories which would have to be provided would probably make the plant fully as much, if not more, complicated than the present. We might, of course, place the batteries at or near the coal mine, and from there transmit the energy to distant points in the form of high-tension alternating currents obtained from rotating transformers, but even in this most favorable case the process would be a barbarous one, certainly more so than the present, as it would still involve the consumption of material, while at the same time it would restrict the engineer and mechanic in the exercise of their beautiful art. As to the energy supply in small isolated places as dwellings, I have placed my confidence in the development of a light storage battery, involving the use of chemicals manufactured by cheap water power, such as some carbide or oxygen-hydrogen cell.

But we shall not satisfy ourselves simply with improving steam and explosive engines or inventing new batteries; we have something much better to work for, a greater task to fulfill. We have to evolve means for obtaining energy from stores which are forever inexhaustible, to perfect methods which do not imply consumption and waste of any material whatever. Upon this great possibility, which I have long ago recognized, upon this great problem, the practical solution of which means so much for humanity, I have myself concentrated my efforts since a number of years, and a few happy ideas which came to me have inspired me to attempt the most difficult, and given me strength and courage in adversity. Nearly six years ago my confidence had become strong enough to prompt me to an expression of hope in the ultimate solution of this all dominating problem. I have made progress since, and have passed the stage of mere conviction such as is derived from a diligent study of known facts, conclusions and calculations. I now feel sure that the realization of that idea is not far off. But precisely for this reason I feel impelled to point out here an important fact, which I hope will be remembered. Having examined for a long time the possibilities of the development I refer to, namely, that of the operation of engines on any point of the earth by the energy of the medium, I find that even under the theoretically best conditions such a method of obtaining power can not equal in economy, simplicity and many other features the present method, involving a conversion fo the mechanical energy of running water into electrical energy and the transmission of the latter in the form of currents of very high tension to great distances. Provided, therefore, that we can avail ourselves of currents of sufficiently high tension, a waterfall affords us the most advantageous means of getting power from the sun sufficient for all our wants, and this recognition has impressed me strongly with the future importance of the water power, not so much because of its commercial value, though it may be very great, but chiefly because of its bearing upon our safety and welfare. I am glad to say that also in this latter direction my efforts have not been unsuccessful, for I have devised means which will allow us the use in power transmission of electromotive forces much higher than those practicable with ordinary apparatus. In fact, progress in this field has given me fresh hope that I shall see the fulfillment of one of my fondest dreams; namely, the transmission of power from station to station without the employment of any connecting wire. Still, whatever method of transmission be ultimately adopted, nearness to the source of power will remain an important advantage.

Gentlemen, some of the ideas I have expressed may appear to many of you hardly realizable; nevertheless, they are the result of long-continued thought and work. You would judge them ore justly if you would have devoted your life to them, as I have done. With ideas it is like with dizzy heights you climb: At first they cause you discomfort and you are anxious to get down, distrustful of your own powers; but soon the remoteness of the turmoil of life and the inspiring influence of the altitude calm your blood; your step gets firm and sure and you begin to look — for dizzier heights. I have attempted to speak to you on “Electricity,” its development and influence, but I fear that I have done it much like a boy who tries to draw a likeness with a few straight lines. But I have endeavored to bring out one feature, to speak to you in one strain which I felt sure would find response in the hearts of all of you, the only one worthy of this occasion — the humanitarian. In the great enterprise at Niagara we see not only a bold engineering and commercial feat, but far more, a giant stride in the right direction as indicated both by exact science and philanthropy. Its success is a signal for the utilization of water powers all over the world, and its influence upon industrial development is incalculable. We must all rejoice in the great achievement and congratulate the intrepid pioneers who have joined their efforts and means to bring it about. It is a pleasure to learn of the friendly attitude of the citizens of Buffalo and of the encouragement given to the enterprise by the Canadian authorities. We shall hope that other cities, like Rochester on this side and Hamilton and Toronto in Canada, will soon follow Buffalo’s lead. This fortunate city herself is to be congratulated. With resources now unequaled, with commercial facilities and advantages such as few cities in the world possess, and with the enthusiasm and progressive spirit of its citizens, it is sure to become one of the greatest industrial centers of the globe.'''

🗞️👨‍💼🧙🗞️ NIKOLA TESLA EXPERIMENTS IN THE MOUNTAINS 🗞️👨‍💼🧙🗞️

                      by Desire Stanton
                  Gazette, Colorado Springs
                      July-August, 1899

    About a quarter of a century past, books of  “Familiar Science”  were popular in certain of our institutions of learning, together with  “Chronology,”  taught as a separate branch, disassociated from events,—and Magnall’s Questions. The exhaustive study of  “Ancient Geography”  was also commended, and  “ a page of dictionary”  was the invariable spelling lesson. Walker was the standard authority, and in his pages the present writer learned to spell music,  “musick,”  and sundry extra  “u’s”  and doubled consonants, which are fine old historical English, Issac Pitman to the contrary notwithstanding. It was the special privilege of the book of  “Familiar Science”  to huri disconnected facts at the scholar’s head—to pelt him with the arbitrary processes of nature—“Why does dew fall?” paraded arm in arm with “Why does a cat’s fur emit sparks when you stroke her in the dark?”

    But the chief glory of the “Book of Familiar Science” was a full-page wood-cut of placid Benjamin Franklin in broad-brim and gaiters, flying his scientific kite, and bringing lightning down from the skies by the aid of a large door key. The experiment marked the beginning of electrical science in America. “The knowledge of this world passeth away.”

away.”[sic]
    
    In the first       years of       1800, Lieutenant Pike camped at the foot of his great “Mexican mountain”—that  “far blue cloud” which allured him over many a mile of wilderness march, and from his reports of discovery of Pike’s Peak and exploration at the head-waters of the Platte and Arkansas, began the exodus from the Missouri river—first over the  Sante Fe  trail  direct—and then  gradually  diverted  to  the north,  where  “Pike’s Peak or Bust!”  became the motto of the  “’59er.”

    The years to be dated 1800 are fast drawing to a close, and in spanning them in thought, with all their stirring happenings and marvelous achievements, not a hundred years later than Zebulon Pike, we find another discoverer  camped  at the foot of  Pike’s  Peak,  armed  with a more mighty key to electrical science than that of Poor Richard.

    Nikola Tesla, the Servian scientist, whose electrical discoveries are not of one nation, but the pride of  the world, has taken up his abode in Colorado Springs, where he will remain for some time conducting experiments in the medium of light air, and perpetual sunshine.

    On East Pike’s Peak avenue, with limitless plains stretching to the eastward, and a panorama of  mighty mountains swooping away north and south, to the west—Tesla has caused to be constructed a station for scientific research. It is a building, which, when complete, will cover an area of from 50 to 60 feet, with an extension with two windows and a large door. The structure is about 18 feet high, and crowned with a large platform. The center of the building remains unroofed to permit the scientific apparatus to project above, and to be inspected and regulated from the surrounding  balcony. The structure has been built according to Mr. Tesla’s own plans, and in telegraphing without wires from plain to mountain, or from mountain to plain, it would occupy and equally central station.

    It is said that Mr. Tesla’s experiments will take this direction, though he is, naturally, reticent upon these points, until he is assured, by the success of his experiments, that the results are prepared to meet the demands of the scientific world.
    
    With Tesla’s wireless telegraph oscillator, he affirms he could talk to the inhabitants of the planet Mars, and will talk to the people of this earth, at any distance away, without the assistance of wires. Into the great oscillator Tesla will turn an ordinary current of electricity. The os-

                     MOUNTAIN SUNSHINE

cillator instantly transforms this electric current, by a series of coils, into an electro-motive force, vibrating at the rate of 2,000,000 to 4,000,000 times a second. This starts electric waves through the air and earth, which vibrate almost as fast as the waves that produce light, and travel with the same speed. These waves, like X-rays, pass through any dense substances, and, according to Tesla, there is nothing to prevent the transmission of messages by their aid directly through the earth. Tesla’s plan for cabling across the Atlantic is to erect two terminal stations, one in London and one in New York, with oscillators placed at the top of high towers, communicating thence with great disks suspended in captive balloons floating 5,000 feet above the earth to catch the strata of rarefied air through which electrical waves travel most easily. A message could be flashed instantly by these lightning rays from the oscillator to the disk in the balloon, and across the thousands of miles of intervening space to the second disk. Cable tolls would be reduced to a minimum ,and[sic] messages flashed around the world at little more than letter postage rates. Mr. Tesla says he is ready to put his wireless system into operation as soon as the practical details can be arranged.


    In inter-planetary communication, however, it would be necessary to have a receiver upon the objective star, and it is also a pre-requisite that the inhabitant of Venus or Mars (if there he be) should—unlike some who wear the uniform in this sublunary sphere—“know enough to take a message.”


    The oscillator, charged, seems like a vivid sphere, fairly radiating light and glorious possibilities. Who that has looked into the soft green depths of light, in the heart of which lies hidden the X-Ray (to which matter is no longer opaque and impenetrable). has not felt that under the touch of electric light and force, power is limitless and the future boundless?

    In Bulwer-Lytton’s novel of “The Coming Race” the heroine was a “perfect woman, nobly planned.” On a superhuman scale. She and her sisters took the initiative in all good and wise achievement, while the men of the coming race somewhat lagged in the rear. By means of the “vril” staff, power was transmitted or arrested, in an incredible degree. The labor of the coming race was performed by automata, vivified and directed by the action of “vril.” According to the mind of him who held the staff. In the spirit of the woman who wished that “posterity was here—right now." the employer of the present longs for the “vril” staff. There are so many, who, upon attempt of direction by the guiding mind, do the thing that is not wanted, in just the way that is not desirable or right.

    Colorado, with her enfranchised women, opens a future for the sisterhood of the coming race. Tesla, in an interview with a representative of the Denver Republican, indicated that the day of “vril power” is not far distant.

    
    '''I would,’’’ said Tesla. '''light whole cities and give to mere machines all the motions of intelligence. I have given demonstrations of this discovery of mine before bodies of men of science many times, but they have found it difficult to believe me. I gave a demonstration of one experiment, which I think is the most beautiful I have ever tried. I think if I live a long life and work all the time I shall never have a more beautiful experiment than that. I had a boat without crew or captain, which I controlled merely by the force of my intelligence. I would will '''turn,’’’ and it would turn, '''go to the right,’’’ and it would go to the right, '''to the left,’’’ it would go to the left. The beautiful thing about it was that it seem to be instinct with life, and, as a dog obeys the commands of his master, so this machine obeyed mind. And yet, it was governed simply by the electrical waves striking upon a receiver. 🐇 And so with any machine.

    '''Why I could make an automaton in the shape of a man that could walk, move, perform all the motions of a man, except wherein the fact of it not being an organic being would 🐇 make a difference. All this theory is developed from my idea that the actions of all inanimate beings are governed by impressions from outside objects received upon the eye.
    
    '''My idea is that people are simply automata, governed by the transmission of circumstances surrounding them upon the eye. 🐇 This is the greatest idea of the age. The relations of nations will be affected by it. It will revolutionize thought. It may take years, but it will gradually come about. Men of science find it difficult to accept this idea. They cannot comprehend it. It is stupendous, and yet it is very simple.’’’


    Colorado may be the theatre of the first exhibition of “vril.”

    Mr. Tesla announces that he is at Colorado Springs, simply collecting experimental data. His instruments will shortly be mounted, and scientific work will begin. He has made similar experiments at different atmospheric levels, and the work here will be comparative.

    Nikola Tesla is from the mountains of Servia, and his native tongue is Montenegrin. To those familiar with foreign types, he suggests the Pole—the grave and gentle temperament illumined by the flash of fire. He is very tall and slight, with thin and delicate features, black hair and mustache, and clear gray eyes. He speaks of himself and his work with simple modesty and reticence, in perfect English, with a slight foreign accent.

    Mr. Leonard E. Curtis, a well-known member of the bar, who has been Tesla’s legal adviser, gave a banquet to the famous electrician at the El Paso Club, where twenty gentlemen of Colorado Springs were invited to meet him, including Governor Thomas, of Colorado. Tesla was in his happiest vein and spoke of his life and work. When first he heard of the great Niagara of the western hemisphere, he was impressed with its power—mighty, resistless force! Some day he would turn it to account. Years after he went to Buffalo, and in the great power plant at Niagara he saw machinery bearing the name of Tesla.

    All who were present at the banquet felt, if it may be so stated without bathos, that they had “soared toward the empyrean,” for a glimpse of the glory that excellent; the man in the midst of the fire; the controlling power, 
“Half spirit and half bird.
And all a wonder and a wild desire.”
                                                  DESIRE STANTON.

“Now shine your very brightest.” Said Dame Na-

War is a negative force, and cannot be turned in a positive direction without passing through the intermediate phases. It is the problem of making a wheel, rotating one way, turn in the opposite direction without slowing it down, stopping it, and speeding it up again the other way.

As the first step toward this realization I conceived the following mechanism. Imagine a thermopile consisting of a number of bars of metal extending from the earth to the outer space beyond the atmosphere. The heat from below, conducted upward along these metal bars, would cool the earth or the sea or the air, according to the location of the lower parts of the bars, and the result, as is well known, would be an electric current circulating in these bars. The two terminals of the thermopile could now be joined through an electric motor, and, theoretically, this motor would run on and on, until the media below would be cooled down to the temperature of the outer space. 

But was it not possible to realize a similar condition without necessarily going to a height?

As regards heat, we are at a high level, which may be represented by the surface of a mountain lake considerably above the sea, the level of which may mark the absolute zero of temperature existing in the interstellar space. Heat, like water, flows from high to low level, and, consequently, just as we can let the water of the lake run down to the sea, so we are able to let heat from the earth's surface travel up into the cold region above. Heat, like water, can perform work in flowing down, and if we had any doubt as to whether we could derive energy from the medium by means of a thermopile, as before described, it would be dispelled by this analogue. But can we produce cold in a given portion of the space and cause the heat to flow in continually? To create such a "sink," or "cold hole," as we might say, in the medium, would be equivalent to producing in the lake a space either empty or filled with something much lighter than water. This we could do by placing in the lake a tank, and pumping all the water out of the latter. We know, then, that the water, if allowed to flow back into the tank, would, theoretically, be able to perform exactly the same amount of work which was used in pumping it out, but not a bit more. Consequently nothing could be gained in this double operation of first raising the water and then letting it fall down. This would mean that it is impossible to create such a sink in the medium. But let us reflect a moment. Heat, though following certain general laws of mechanics, like a fluid, is not such; it is energy which may be converted into other forms of energy as it passes from a high to a low level. To make our mechanical analogy complete and true, we must, therefore, assume that the water, in its passage into the tank, is converted into something else, which may be taken out of it without using any, or by using very little, power. For example, if heat be represented in this analogue by the water of the lake, the oxygen and hydrogen composing the water may illustrate other forms of energy into which the heat is transformed in passing from hot to cold. If the process of heat transformation were absolutely perfect, no heat at all would arrive at the low level, since all of it would be converted into other forms of energy.

Corresponding to this ideal case, all the water flowing into the tank would be decomposed into oxygen and hydrogen before reaching the bottom, and the result would be that water would continually flow in, and yet the tank would remain entirely empty, the gases formed escaping.

We would thus produce, by expending initially a certain amount of work to create a sink for the heat or, respectively, the water to flow in, a condition enabling us to get any amount of energy without further effort.

This would be an ideal way of obtaining motive power.

We do not know of any such absolutely perfect process of heat-conversion, and consequently some heat will generally reach the low level, which means to say, in our mechanical analogue, that some water will arrive at the bottom of the tank, and a gradual and slow filling of the latter will take place, necessitating continuous pumping out. But evidently there will be less to pump out than flows in, or, in other words, less energy will be needed to maintain the initial condition than is developed by the fall, and this is to say that some energy will be gained from the medium. What is not converted in flowing down can just be raised up with its own energy, and what is converted is clear gain.

Thus the virtue of the principle I have discovered resides wholly in the conversion of the energy on the downward flow.

Apart from love and religion there happened the other day to Mr. Tesla the most momentous experience that has ever visited a human being on this earth. As he sat beside his instrument on the hillside in Colorado, in the deep silence of that austere, inspiring region, where you plant your feel in gold and your head brushes the constellations — as he sat there one evening, alone, his attention, exquisitively alive at that juncture, was arrested by a faint sound from the receiver — three fairy taps, one after the other, at a fixed (The most essential requirement is, however, that irrespective of frequency the wave or wave-train should continue for a certain interval of time, which I have estimated to be not less than one-twelfth or probably 0.08484 of a second and which is taken in passing to and returning from the region diametrically opposite the pole over the earth’s surface with a mean velocity of about four hundred and seventy-one thousand two hundred and forty kilometers per second.) interval. What man who has ever lived on this earth would not envy Tesla that moment! Never before since the globe first swung into form had that sound been heard. Those three soft impulses, reflected from the sensitive disc of the receiver, had not proceeded from any earthly source. The force which propelled them, the measure which regarded them, the significance they were meant to convey, had their origin in no mind native to this planet.
They were sent, those marvelous signals, by a human being living and thinking so far away from us, both in space and in condition, that we can only accept him as a fact, not comprehend him as a phenomenon. Traveling with the speed of light, they must have been dispatched but a few moments before Tesla, in Colorado, received them. But they came fromj some Nicolas 🐇 on the planet Mars!

🗞️ THE WONDER WORLD TO BE CREATED BY ELECTRICITY 🗞️
by Nikola Tesla
Manufacturer's Record
September 9th, 1915

...'''The superstitious belief of the ancients, if it existed at all, can therefore not be taken as a reliable proof of their ignorance, but just how much they knew about electricity can only be conjectured. A curious fact is that the ray or torpedo fish was used by them in electrotherapy. Some old coins show twin stars, or sparks, such as might be produced by a galvanic battery. The records, though scanty, are of a nature to fill us with conviction that a few initiated, at least, had a deeper knowledge of amber phenomena. To mention one, Moses was undoubtedly a practical and skillful electrician far in advance of his time. The Bible describes precisely and minutely arrangements constituting a machine in which electricity was generated by friction of air against silk curtains and stored in a box constructed like a condenser. It is very plausible to assume that the sons of Aaron were killed by a high-tension discharge, and that the vestal fires of the Romans were electrical. The belt drive must have been known to engineers of that epoch, and it is difficult to see how the abundant evolution of static electricity could have escaped their notice. Under favorable atmospheric conditions a belt may be transformed into a dynamic generator capable of producing many striking actions. I have lighted incandescent lamps, operated motors and performed numerous other equally interesting experiments with electricity drawn from belts and stored in tin cans.

That many facts in regard to the subtle force were known to the philosophers of old can be safely concluded. The wonder is, why 2000 years elapsed before Gilbert in 1600 published his famous work, the first scientific treatise on electricity and magnetism. To an extent this long period of unproductiveness can be explained. Learning was the privilege of a few and all information was jealously guarded. Communication was difficult and slow, and a mutual understanding between widely-separated investigators hard to reach. Then again, men of those times had no thought of the practical; they lived and fought for abstract principles, creeds, traditions and ideals. Humanity did not change much in Gilbert’s time, but his clear teachings had a telling effect on the minds of the learned. Friction machines were produced in rapid succession and experiments and observations multiplied. Gradually fear and superstition gave way to scientific insight and in 1745 the world was thrilled with the news that Kleist and Leyden had succeeded in imprisoning the uncanny agent in a phial from which it escaped with an angry snap and destructive force. This was the birth of the condenser, perhaps the most marvelous electrical device ever invented.

Two tremendous leaps were made in the succeeding 40 years. One was when Franklin demonstrated the identity between the gentle soul of amber and the awe-inspiring bolt of Jupiter; the other when Galvany and Volta brought out the contact and chemical battery, from which the magic fluid could be drawn in unlimited quantities. The succeeding 40 years bore still greater fruit. Oersted made a significant advance in deflecting a magnetic needle by an electric current, Arago produced the electro-magnet, Seebeck the thermopile and in 1831, as the crowning achievement of all, Faraday announced that he had obtained electricity from a magnet, thus discovering the principle of that wonderful engine, the dynamo, and inaugurating a new era both in scientific research and practical application.

From that time on inventions of inestimable value have followed one another at a bewildering rate. The telegraph, telephone, phonograph and incandescent lamp, the induction motor, oscillatory transformer, Roentgen ray, Radium, wireless and numerous other revolutionary advances have been made and all conditions of existence profoundly modified. In 84 years which have since elapsed the subtle agents dwelling in the living amber and loadstone have been transformed into cyclopean forces, turning the wheels of human progress with ever-increasing speed. This, in brief, is the fairy tale of electricity from Thales to the present day. The impossible has happened, the wildest dreams have been surpassed and the astounded world is asking. What is coming next?'''...

'''Every living being is an engine geared to the wheelwork of the universe. Though seemingly affected only by its immediate surrounding, the sphere of external influence extends to infinite distance. There is no constellation or nebula, no sun or planet, in all the depths of limitless space, no passing wanderer of the starry heaven, that does not exercise some control over its destiny

— not in the vague and delusive sense of astrology,
🐇
but in the rigid and positive meaning of physical science.

More than this can be said. There is no thing endowed with life—from man, who is enslaving the elements, to the humblest creature—in all this world that does not sway it in turn. Whenever action is born from force, though it be infinitesimal, 🐇 the cosmic balance is upset and universal motion result.'''


"Nikola Tesla, who, with Thomas A. Edison is to share the Nobel Prize in Physics, according to a dispatch from London, said last evening that he had not yet been officially notified of the honor. His only information on the matter was the dispatch in THE NEW YORK TIMES."

'''I have concluded,''' he said, '''that the honor has been conferred upon me in acknowledgment of a discovery announced a short time ago which concerns the transmission of electrical energy without wires. This discovery means that electrical effects of unlimited intensity and power can be produced, so that not only can energy be transmitted for all practical purposes to any terrestrial distance, 🐇 but even effects of cosmic magnitude may be created.'''

"Mr. Tesla refused to go further into the matter. He said he thought Mr. Edison was worthy of a dozen Nobel prizes. He knew nothing of the discovery, he said, that induced the authorities in Sweden to confer the great honor on Mr. Edison."


"Nikola Tesla, the inventor,

winner of the 1915 Nobel Physics Prize, 🙄 😅

has filed patent applications on the essential parts of a machine the possibilities of which test a layman's imagination and promise a parallel of Thor's shooting thunderbolts from the sky to punish those who had angered the gods. Dr. Tesla insists there is nothing sensational about it, that it is but the fruition of many years of work and study. He is not yet ready to give the details of the engine which he says will render fruitless any military expedition against a country which possesses it. Suffice to say that the destructive invention will go through space with a speed of

300 miles a second,

to any desired point on the globe on its errand of destruction, if destruction its manipulator wishes to effect."

"It is not the time,” said Dr. Tesla yesterday, '''to go into the details of this thing. It is founded on a principle that means great things in peace; it can be used for great things in war. But I repeat, this is no time to talk of such things'''


'''In a thousand years, there will be many recipients of the Nobel Prize, but I have not less than four dozen of my creations identified with my name in the technical literature. These are honors real and permanent, which are bestowed, not by a few who are apt to err, but by the whole world which seldom makes a mistake and for any of those I could give all the Nobel prizes which will be distributed during the next thousand years'''

In fact, I could not then procure X-ray generators to handle even a small fraction of the power I had available. But I now have apparatus designed whereby this tremendous energy of hundreds of kilowatts can be successfully transformed into X-rays.'''

'''The truth is, the so-called “axial rotation” of the moon is a phenomenon deceptive alike to the eye and mind and devoid of physical meaning. It has nothing in common with real mass revolution characterized by effects positive and unmistakable. Volumes have been written on the subject and many erroneous arguments advanced in support of the notion. Thus, it is reasoned, that if the planet did not turn on its axis it would expose the whole surface to terrestrial view; as only one-half is visible, it must revolve. The first statement is true but the logic of the second is defective, for it admits of only one alternative.'''
🐇
'''Consider now the process taking place in the transmission by the instrumentalities and methods of my invention. For this purpose attention is called to Fig. 8, which gives an idea of the mode of propagation of the current waves and is largely self-explanatory. The drawing represents a solar eclipse with the shadow of the moon just touching the surface of the earth at a point where the transmitter is located. As the shadow moves downward it will spread over the earth’s surface, first with infinite and then gradually diminishing velocity until at a distance of about 6,000 miles it will attain its true 💊 speed in space. From there on it will proceed with increasing velocity, reaching infinite value at the opposite point of the globe. It hardly need be stated that this is merely an illustration and not an accurate representation in the astronomical sense.'''
'''The exact law will be readily understood by reference to Fig. 9, in which a transmitting circuit is shown connected to earth and to an antenna. The transmitter being in action, two effects are produced: Hertz waves pass thru the air, and a current traverses the earth. The former propagate with the speed of light and their energy is unrecoverable in the circuit. The latter proceeds with the speed varying as the cosecant of the angle which a radius drawn from any point under consideration forms with the axis of symmetry of the waves. At the origin the speed is infinite but gradually diminishes until a quadrant is traversed, when the velocity is that of light. From there on it again increases, becoming infinite at the antipole. Theoretically the energy of this current is recoverable in its entirety, in properly attuned receivers.'''
🐇
'''From the foregoing it will be seen that in order to make one physical revolution on its axis the moon should have twice its present angular velocity, and then it would contain a quantity of stored energy as given in my above letter to the New York Tribune, on the assumption that the radius of gyration is 2/5 that of figure. This, of course, is uncertain, as the distribution of density in the interior is unknown. But from the character of motion of the satellite it may be concluded with certitude that it is devoid of momentum about its axis. If it be bisected by a plane tangential to the orbit, the masses of the two halves are inversely as the distances of their centers of gravity from the earth’s center and, therefore, if the latter were to disappear suddenly, no axial rotation, as in the case of a weight thrown off, would ensue.'''


'''All my previous efforts with Rhumkorf coils had left me unconvinced, and in order to settle my doubts I went over the whole ground once more, very carefully, with these improved appliances. Similar phenomena were noted, greatly magnified in intensity, but they were susceptible of a different and more plausible explanation. I considered this so important that in 1892 I went to Bonn, Germany, to confer with Dr. Hertz in regard to my observations. He seemed disappointed to such a degree that I regretted my trip and parted from him sorrowfully.

During the succeeding years I made numerous experiments with the same object, but the results were uniformly negative. In 1900, however, after I had evolved a wireless transmitter which enabled me to obtain electro-magnetic activities of many millions of horse-power, I made a last desperate attempt to prove that the disturbances emanating from the oscillator were ether vibrations akin to those of light, but met again with utter failure. For more than eighteen years I have been reading treatises, reports of scientific transactions, and articles on Hertz-wave telegraphy, to keep myself informed, but they have always imprest me like works of fiction.'''

🐇 '''In time, however, I recognized that devices of this kind, to be most effective and efficient, should be designed with due regard to the physical properties of this planet and the electrical conditions obtaining on the same."...

'''But, altho I have overcome all obstacles which seemed in the beginning unsurmountable and found elegant solutions of all the problems which confronted me, yet, even at this very day, the majority of experts are still blind to the possibilities which are within easy attainment."...

'''The underlying principle can be explained in a few words. Suppose that there are n simple vibrations suitable for use in wireless transmission, the probability that any one tune will be struck by an extraneous disturbance is 1/n. There will then remain n-1 vibrations and the chance that one of these will be excited is 1/n-1 hence the probability that two tunes would be struck at the same time is 1/n(n-1). Similarly, for a combination of three the chance will be 1/n(n-1)(n-2) and so on. It will be readily seen that in this manner any desired degree of safety against the statics or other kind of disturbance can be attained provided the receiving apparatus is so designed that is operation is possible only thru the joint action of all the tuned elements. This was a difficult problem which I have successfully solved so that now any desired number of simultaneous messages is practicable in the transmission thru the earth as well as thru artificial conductors.'''...

'''It occurs to me here to ask the question — why have the Hertz waves been reduced from the original frequencies to those I have advocated for my system, when in so doing the activity of the transmitting apparatus has been reduced a billion fold? I can invite any expert to perform an experiment such as is illustrated in Fig. 15, which shows the classical Hertz oscillator and my grounded transmitting circuit. It is a fact which I have demonstrated that, altho we may have in the Hertz oscillator an activity thousands of times greater, the effect on the receiver is not to be compared to that of the grounded circuit. 
This shows that in the transmission from an airplane we are merely working thru a condenser, the capacity of which is a function of a logarithmic ratio between the length of the conductor and the distance from the ground. The receiver is affected in exactly the same manner as from an ordinary transmitter, the only difference being that there is a certain modification of the action which can be predetermined from the electrical constants. It is not at all difficult to maintain communication between an airplane and a station on the ground, on the contrary, the feat is very easy.'''


'''Evidently, when an object in seen, consciousness of the external form can only be due to the fact that those cones and rods of the retina which are covered by the image are affected differently from the rest, and it is speculation not to hazardous to assume that visualization is accompanied by reflex action on the retina which may be detected by suitable instruments. In this way it might also be possible to project the reflex action on a screen, and with further refinement, resorting to the principle involved in moving picture, the continuous play of thots might be rendered visible, recorded and at will reproduced.'''


'''As stated on a previous occasion, when I was a student at college I conceived a flying machine quite unlike the present ones. The underlying principle was sound but could not be carried into practice for want of a prime-mover of sufficiently great activity. In recent years I have successfully solved this problem and am now planning

which will be capable of immense speeds 💊

and are very likely to furnish powerful arguments for peace in the near future. Such a machine, sustained and

propelled entirely by reaction,

is shown on page 108 and is supposed to be controlled either mechanically or by wireless energy. By installing proper plants it will be practicable to project a missile of this kind into the air and drop it almost on the very spot designated, which may be thousands of miles away. But we are not going to stop at this. 🐇 Telautomata will be ultimately produced, capable of acting as if possest of their own intelligence, and their advent will create a revolution. As early as 1898 I proposed to representatives of a large manufacturing concern the construction and public exhibition of an automobile carriage which, left to itself, would perform a great variety of operations involving something akin to judgment. But my proposal was deemed chimerical at that time and nothing came from it.'''

HELLO, EARTH! HELLO!
🐇 Marconi believes he is receiving signals from the planets
"The most familiar signal received Is curiously musical. It comes In the form of three short raps, which may be Interpreted as the Morse letter S, but there are other sounds which may stand for other letters. 

Nikola Tesla, the famous Serbian inventor and electrical expert says:
'''Marconi's Idea of communicating with the other planets is the greatest and most fascinating problem confronting the human imagination today. To Insure success a body of competent scientists should be organized to study all possible plans and put into execution the best. The matter should be directed probably by astronomers with sufficient backing from men with money and imagination. Supposing that there are intelligent human beings on Mars, success is easily within the range of possibility. In March, 1907, I stated in the Harvard Illustrated Magazine that experiments looking to communication with other planets should be undertaken.
'''In 1899 I built an electric plant in Colorado and obtained activities of 18,000,000 horsepower. In the course of my experiments I employed a receiver of virtually unlimited sensitiveness. There were no other wireless plants near, and, at that time, no other wireless plants anywhere on this earth of sufficient range to affect mine. One day my ear caught what seemed to be regular signals. I knew that they could not have been produced upon the earth. The possibility that they came from Mars occurred to me, but the pressure of business affairs caused me to drop the experiment.
'''The thing, I think, that we should try to develop Is a plan akin to picture transmission, by means of which we could convey to the Inhabitants of Mars knowledge of earthly forms. This would enable up to exchange with them not only simple primitive facts, but involved conceptions. To talk to Mars seems to me only a matter of electric power and perseverance.'''
Pro. Albert Einstein, the German astronomer and author of the theory of "Relativity" that is apparently upsetting all accepted doctrines, believes 🐇 that Mars and other planets are inhabited but if intelligent creatures are trying to communicate with the earth he should expect them to use rays of light, which would much more easily be controlled.

🐇 '''The mode of propagation of the currents from my transmitter through the terrestrial globe is most extraordinary considering the spread of the electrification of the surface. The wave starts with a theoretically infinite speed, slowing down first very quickly and afterward at a lesser rate until the distance is about six thousand miles, when it proceeds with the speed of light. From there on it again increases in speed, slowly at first, and then more rapidly, reaching the antipode with approximately infinite velocity. The law of motion can be expressed by stating that the waves on the terrestrial surface sweep in equal intervals of time over equal areas, but it must be understood that the current penetrates deep into the earth and the effects produced on the receivers are the same as if the whole flow was confined to the earth’s axis joining the transmitter with the antipode. The mean surface speed is thus about 471,200 kilometers per second — fifty-seven per cent. greater than that of the so-called Hertz waves — which should propagate with the velocity of light if they exist. The same constant was found by the noted American astronomer, Capt. J. T. T. See, in his mathematical investigations, for the smallest particles of the ether which he fittingly designates as “etherons.” But while in the light of his theory this speed is a physical reality, the spread of the currents at the terrestrial surface is much like the passage of the moon’s shadow over the globe.
It will be difficult for most people engaged in practical pursuits to measure or even to form an adequate conception of the intensity of inspiration and force I derive from that part of my work which has passed into history. I have every reason to consider myself one of the most fortunate men, for I experience incessantly a feeling of inexpressible satisfaction that my alternating system is universally employed in the transmission and distribution of heat, light and power and that also my wireless system, in all its essential features, is used throughout the world for conveying intelligence. But my pioneer efforts in this later field are still grossly misunderstood.'''

'''When Dr. Heinrich Hertz undertook his experiments from 1887 to 1889 his object was to demonstrate a theory postulating a medium filling all space, called the ether, which was structureless, of inconceivable tenuity and yet solid and possessed of rigidity incomparably greater than that of the hardest steel. He obtained certain results and 🐇 the whole world acclaimed them as an experimental verification of that cherished theory. But in reality what he observed tended to prove just its fallacy.

I had maintained for many years before that such a medium as supposed could not exist, and that we must rather accept the view that all space is filled with a gaseous substance. On repeating the Hertz experiments with much improved and very powerful apparatus, I satisfied myself that what he had observed was nothing else but effects of longitudinal waves in a gaseous medium, that is to say, waves, propagated by alternate compression and expansion. He had observed waves in the ether much of the nature of sound waves in the air.

Up to 1896, however, I did not succeed in obtaining a positive experimental proof of the existence of such a medium. But in that year I brought out a new form of vacuum tube capable of being charged to any desired potential, and operated it with effective pressures of about 4,000,000 volts. I produced cathodic and other rays of transcending intensity. The effects, according to my view, were due to minute particles of matter carrying enormous electrical charges, which, for want of a better name, I designated as matter not further decomposable. Subsequently those particles were called electrons.'''


"—Back in 1894 a long, lean, almost cadaverous, looking man used to enthrall Ward McAllister and other playboys at Delmonico's with dissertations on the fly — and how he could fly! And maybe man would get that way some day, too. That was Nikola Tesla from the kingdom of Lika, on the borders of Austria-Hungary, but rubbed out of existence as an independent State long before the big war. Mr. Tesla's visions suggested hashish to some rock ribbed scientists,

but in 1915 he got the Nobel physics prize 😭 😂

for his research in energy transmission, his take-off in today's prophecy. While he has called many of the modern scientific miracles in advance, some are still in suspense,

notably his prediction that

some day the Atlantic Ocean will be lit up

like Forty-second street and Broadway

by some comparatively simple, electrical conjuring.—"


'''Tesla contradicts a part of the relativity theory emphatically, holding that mass is unalterable; otherwise, energy could be produced from nothing, since the kinetic energy acquired in the fall of a body would be greater than that necessary to lift it at a small velocity.'''

Tesla Describes His Beam of Destructive Energy

Invention of a ‘‘‘beam of matter moving at high velocity’’’ which would act as a ‘‘‘beam of destructive energy’’’ was announced today by Dr. Nikola Tesla, the inventor, in his annual birthday interview. Dr. Tesla is 78, and for the past several years has made his anniversary the occasion for an announcement of scientific discoveries.

The beam, as described by the inventor to rather bewildered reporters, would be projected on land from power houses set 200 miles or so apart and would provide an impenetrable wall about a country in time of war. Anything with which the ray came in contact would be destroyed, the inventor indicated. Planes would fall, armies would be wiped out and even the smallest country might so insure ‘‘‘security’’’ against which nothing could avail.

Dr. Tesla announced that he plans to suggest his method at Geneva as an insurance of peace.

🗞️ TRIBUTE TO KING ALEXANDER 🗞️
by Nikola Tesla
New York Times
October 21st, 1934 Page number(s): 5
To The Editor of The New York Times:

'''Much has been said about Yugoslavia and its people, but many Americans may be under a wrong impression for political enemies and agitators have spread the idea that its inhabitants belong to different nations animated by mutual hate and held together against their will, by a tyrannical power. The fact is that all Yugoslavs-Serbians, Slavonians, Bosnians, Herzegovinians, Dalmations, Montenagrins, Croatians and Slovenes - are of the same race, speak the same language and have common national ideals and traditions.

At the termination of the World War, Alexander brought about a political union creating a powerful and resourceful State. This was hailed with joy by all the Slavs of the Balkans, but it took time before the people found themselves in the new conditions.

    Serbs Did the Fighting.
I was born in Croatia. The Croatians and Slovenes were never in a position to fight for their independence. It was the Serbians who fought the battles for freedom and the price of liberty was paid in Serbian blood. All true Croatians and Slovenes remember that gratefully. They also know that the Serbians have an unequalled aptitude and experience in warfare and are best qualified to direct the forces of the country in a crisis.

Ever since united Yugoslavia came into being through Alexander's efforts, political enemies have done all they could to disrupt it by sowing seeds of discord and disseminating malicious reports. An instance of the kind is a book by Louis Adamic, "The Native's Return," which he is supposed to have written under the provisions of the Guggenheim award for literature and in which he indulges in political defamation, denunciation of the ruler of the country and promulgation of ideas as unwelcome here as in Yugoslavia.

His denunciations of the King and reflections on his character can be contemptuously passed, but one thing cannot be ignored. The book contains statements representing the great and fearless man, who has led his people in sanguinary battles, as a weakling in mortal fear of assassination, so much so that he retired every night to a different room and did not show himself until hundreds of his aides had 'I cleared the place and made safe his appearance. This has cut deep into the heart of every loyal Yugoslav.

    Dissensions Denied.
Mr. Adamic is very loud in telling of the hatred and dissensions between Croatians and Slovenes and the Serbians, but recent events have disproved his statements, The[sic?] countries, which according to his accounts ,.[sic?] should be in open revolt, have shown themselves as devoted to the King of Serbia. This has been reflected in several reports of The New York Times, among which is the extraordinarily vivid and dramatic description of the obsequies.

The death of the King has shaken the country to its very foundations, but the enemies who say that it means the disruption of Yugoslavia will hope in vain, for the noble blood of the great man has only served to cement its parts more firmly and strengthen the national structure. Alexander will live long in the memory of his people, a heroic figure of imposing stature, both the Washington and Lincoln of the Yugoslavs; like Washington an able and intrepid general who freed his country from oppression; like Lincoln a wise and patriotic leader who suffered martyrdom.

🗞️ DR. TESLA GIVES HOME TO AN ERRANT PIGEON 🗞️
    THAT FLEW INTO 40TH-STORY ROOM IN HOTEL

               New York Times
             February 6th, 1935

Early yesterday morning, not so long after it started snowing, an apologetic housekeeper on the fortieth floor of the Hotel New Yorker — one flight from the roof — telephoned down to the office that there was a bird in one of the unoccupied rooms. Apparently it had flown in a window which had been left partially open during the night, she explained.


When the management arrived on the scene the “bird” was perched on the top of a dresser, as unaccountable as Poe's raven, and twice as ambiguous. It was a homing pigeon with a leg band reading: “I. F. 34 N. U. 1286,” and it seemed to have just got in after a long hard flight. It was caught and shut in a bathroom until its legband could be deciphered.


The news of it spread, however. At 7 o'clock, while the management was still trying to face the anomaly of the homing pigeons without a home, a chambermaid was repeating the story to Dr. Nikola Tesla, the 78-year-old scientist, in his thirty-third floor suite. Dr. Tesla, who is fond of pigeons, as the chambermaid knows from experience, promptly called the management and volunteered to take charge of the foundling.


He was afraid it might be sick, instead of merely storm-driven, Dr. Tesla explained, and since he was already keeping one convalescent pigeon in his room, the two of them might be company for each other. The management gratefully assented. After looking over the bird, Dr. Tesla decided that it wasn’t sick but hungry and a little upset by having gorged itself, for want of anything more edible, on snow. 🐇 He decided to keep it anyway.


Though accustom to walk ten miles daily, Dr. Tesla did not leave his apartment all day yesterday, according to hotel officials. And he is known to have dropped work on a new electrical project he has underway, lest his charge might require some little attention. The man who recently announced the discovery of electrical death-beam, powerful enough to destroy 10,000 airplanes at a swoop, had carefully spread towels on his window ledge and set down a little cup of seed for his two pigeons.

The first pigeon was found in a dying condition ten days ago and is being nursed back to health. The second, after a good feed and rest, will be able to go along home under its own power, Dr. Tesla said. He admitted that he had made a specialty of treating sick pigeons since he was a lad of twelve in his native Croatian village of Smilian.

Nikola Tesla, keen and vigorous at 78, expects to live
                 more than fifty yeas longer

‘‘‘LACKING but two years of eighty, I am as fit today as I was at twenty.’’’

Tall, slim, erect, Nikola Tesla was walking briskly across the mezzanine floor of the metropolitan hotel where he lives. There was a sheen in his white hair, and in his blue eyes an unquenchable fire. Time, the great antagonist of all men, has not been able to worst the illustrious inventor in a bout of nearly four-score years.

In that time, Tesla has given to the world five thousand inventions and ideas. “As a matter of history,” says C. F. Scott, President of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, “it is the Tesla principle and the Tesla system which have been the directing factors in modern electrical engineering practise.” “His name,” adds B. A. Behrend, engineer and author, “marks an epoch in the advance of electrical science.” Tesla discovered wireless before Marconi. He solved the secret of high frequency transmissions. His induction motor runs 10,000 ships and plants. Niagara Falls is chained according to his system.

If Tesla's inventions were suddenly withdrawn, half of the transportation systems and half of the industries of the world would stand still. Today at seventy-eight, Tesla still works in three different laboratories. He devotes the major part of his time to the completion of a device which, if successful, will put an end to war. There are innumerable other tricks in the bag of this electric magician.

I was eager to discover how the man who has energized our epoch and helped to make it the Machine Age, recharges the battery of his own body. I met him one afternoon emerging from a long conference, which in turn had followed many hours of laboratory work. But Tesla showed no trace of fatigue. We talked — talked for two hours. At the end he seemed perfectly fresh and wended his way on foot to a special research room of the New York Public Library where he often devotes many hours to his studies.

“How,” I asked, “do you find it possible to continue your labors with undiminished vigor at seventy-eight? What is your secret of youth?”

A smile crept over Tesla's features. ‘‘‘It is no secret, but common sense. I look upon the human body as a machine, and I treat it with the respect which a machine deserves. I keep it properly oiled and properly cleaned, and I see to it that it has no opportunity to gather rust.

‘‘‘The most important element in my scheme of life is my diet. You cannot expect a machine to function well if you do not provide it with the proper fuel.

‘‘‘Being a scientist, I attempt to regulate the machine which I call my body according to the laws of the planet on which I live. Whatever scheme of life man adopts, it must conform to the physical condition created by the rotation of the globe. The physical law which divides twenty-four hours into day and night also divides man's life into two periods — one in which he lives and another in which he rests. This in itself seems to indicate the desirability of two meals a day in unison with the world rhythm — one meal to give us energy for the day's work, another to supply the body with the material with which it will replenish itself during sleep.

‘‘‘I have been interested in physical culture eyer since I was a young man and have experimented with different nutritional theories. In my early youth I concluded that the ideal way was to absorb food in a fine, almost fluid form and in the proper volume continuously, in small amounts, throughout our hours of work. This method, it seemed to me, would supply steadily energy to the body and impose the least strain upon the digestive organs. Fascinated by the theory, I lived that way for several years, preparing myself dishes consisting of milk, beef juice, and purees. Working in the laboratory, I took my nourishment whenever I felt the need. My health was excellent, my heart and my digestive organs reacted most favorably.

‘‘‘However, my work called me away to places where it was impossible for me to prepare my food in the fashion to which I had accustomed myself. I was compelled to take my meals like other men. The change caused considerable digestive disturbances. My intestines and my stomach had shrunk and my interior organs had lost much of their peristaltic power. It took me a long time to adjust myself to the new regimen.’’’

“How many meals a day did you find most conducive to health?”

Tesla laughed: ‘‘‘I have tried everything - six meals a day, like most Europeans; three a day, one a day; I have tried continuous feeding. Finally I decided that two meals are most beneficial.

‘‘‘Lunch is a superfluous meal, because it is futile in the economy of the human body. Lunch loads the stomach with food which it cannot transform quickly into energy for work. It takes from three to four hours before we can digest our luncheon: three or four hours before the food takes effect. Hence, lunch does not increase our efficiency. On the contrary, the digestive process summons the blood from the brain to the stomach and impedes our mental and physical activities.

‘‘‘One meal a day does not furnish sufficient energy and can not be harmonized with the movement of the clock which regulates our lives — the earth spinning about itself.

‘‘‘Two meals can be distributed so as to fit into the natural scheme prescribed by the rotation of the earth. Two meals a day improved my health, sharpened my appetite, and increased the sensitiveness of my palate. I did not know what life was until I eliminated lunch. Today at seventy-eight I enjoy my two meals to the same degree as when I was a boy of sixteen. I do not suffer from dyspepsia or any other aliment. I never find it necessary to take laxatives or other medicaments.

‘‘‘If my scheme is adopted universally, it will lengthen man's span of life and improve the health of the human race. It is impossible to distribute three meals to advantage. Two meals a day enables the worker to absorb and digest his meal before he begins to work.’’’

“And what is the time which you select for your meals according to your gastro-culinary scheme of existence?”

Tesla is one of our very great men.

This is the inspiring story of what his two-meals-per-day plan and a daily ten-mile walk have done for him. Ten miles of walking and two meals a day of the right food will keep any man still young and strong at Tesla's time of life.

Some of Mr. Tesla's views do not conform to our own in every detail, but are the result of his personal experiences, and our readers are entitled to have the benefit of his views first hand.
— Bernarr Macfadden


‘‘‘The time for eating,’’’ Tesla replied, ‘‘‘depends upon climate and conditions of the country. We should take breakfast two hours before we start to work, and we should rest two hours afterward. If a man has his breakfast between seven and eight, he should begin work at ten, work continuously for five or six hours, which would mean that his work day ended at three or four; then he should go home, and devote several hours to recreation, rest and exercise, and take his final meal between seven and eight at night. This arrangement fits in with the cosmic law as well as with the new hours of labor, and it puts the worker in fine condition.’’’


“What is the fuel which you consider most essential for the human machine?”

‘‘‘Every meal should have some protein and fat, the one for building, the other for burning. Protein builds, fat is a fuel — it energizes.

‘‘‘In the morning fat should be commended, because fat, taken preferably in the form of butter and oil, is what we need for our work. In the evening I suggest a preponderance of protein to rebuild the cells of the body while it rests.’’’

‘‘‘I believe with Bernarr Macfadden in the miracle of milk. There are two hundred and sixty grains of protein in one pint of milk. It is easily assimilated. Mr. Ford, unlike Mr. Macfadden, does not believe in milk. He feels it should be artificially manufactured. Unlike Ford, I believe in milk. Ford should take to milk if he wants to turn out more millions of his ‘Lizzies.’

‘‘‘Another excellent ingredient for food is the white of an egg. There are sixty grains of protein in each white of an egg, and only forty grains in the yolk. I prefer to eat only the white. The yolk contains iron and vitamins which are good, but also uric acid, which I avoid as much as possible. Cheese is the most nourishing of all foods, containing one hundred and forty grains of protein per ounce. The next best protein-containing substances are certain cereals which contain thirty to thirty-five grains per ounce of food. Rice carries the least uric acid and can be assimilated most easily.

‘‘‘A large amount of protein is contained in pulses or leguminous products, beans, peas, lentils, etc. But they also contain no small amount of uric acid. Uric acid is responsible for most ailments which impede the metabolistic processes of the body, It causes rheumatic conditions, arthritis, high blood pressure, and many other maladies of civilized life. Primitive man may have been able to eliminate uric acid thoroughly by hard physical labor. The city dweller should be exceedingly cautions before he introduces large amounts into his system.

‘‘‘Vegetables are indispensable to any diet, although they contain only six or seven grains of protein per ounce. They do not build and they supply little energy, but they regulate the bowels and counteract uric acid. They also supply the body with the vitamins and essential mineral salts. Moreover, they are convenient carriers for fat. I am fond of a fine, cooked mixture of onions and chopped celery prepared with a great deal of butter. This combination is easily digested. I have in part subsisted on it for many years.

‘‘‘Fruit, too, is an essential part of any well-regulated diet. It is indispensable, partly because of its bulk which aids the digestion, and partly because of its alkaline reaction. It is a well-known fact that even citrous fruits, which have an acid reaction at first, change to alkaline in the processes of digestion. The alkaline are the natural enemies of the acids. Sugar in small amounts is not objectionable. There is, however, plenty of sugar in fruit.’’’

“Are you a vegetarian or a carnivorous animal?”

Tesla replied, ‘‘‘I eat meat only at rare intervals, possibly only once or twice a year. It is rich in proteins but also in uric acid. I prefer fowl to beef. Fish is more digestible and almost equally rich in proteins and in fats. The phosphorous it contains is excellent for the nervous system. But phosphorus, while feeding the brain, causes acidity. Both meat and fish give us quick energy. Under certain conditions, for certain workers, they are indispensable. They shorten life by introducing more uric acid into the system than it can conveniently eliminate. But while we live they give us considerable vigor.’’’

“And what,” I asked, “is your attitude toward alcohol?”


‘‘‘Since prohibition was enacted I have not touched a drop, and long before that I gave up all other stimulants. I gave up alcohol, in spite of the fact that it was beneficial to me, in obedience to the law, and I find that I cannot now return to it. I had previously expected to live 150 years. 🐇 Now that I have given up alcohol, I have reduced my expectancy of life to 135 years. In Yugoslavia, where I was born, alcoholic drinks are taken regularly with meals. That habit rarely leads to drunkenness.

‘‘‘Alcohol has helped me a great deal in my life. It has made possible for me to escape from a strain which otherwise might have proved fatal. The man who is not an inventor cannot realize how powerfully the entire system may be affected by the discovery of a new truth. When I first saw my own invention, the induction motor, at work, my heart nearly gave out. Fortunately a bottle of brandy was near at hand of which I partook. This balanced my nervous excitement, and I was able to survey the rotation of the motor with philosophic poise.


‘‘‘I was strongly addicted to coffee, with the result that my heart was subjected to a dangerous over-strain. It took me eleven years to vanquish my craving for this pernicious drink. The cure cost me a good deal of money. For eleven years I had the finest coffee prepared for me at my table every day, and never touched a drop. Its presence aroused my powers of resistance. If it had not been there I would have suffered from the craving. I, at least, have found coffee and tea rank poisons.’’’

“You have not,” I interrupted, “expressed your opinion on beer.”

‘‘‘I have cared less for beer than for wine or brandy. As a young student I drank beer moderately, about sixteen seidels a day, whereas most of my fellow students consumed sixty. Beer gave me a katzenjammer. It is drunk in large quantities because for some reason it is easily absorbed. No one can drink twenty or thirty glasses of water or milk, but it is not difficult to drink thirty or forty glasses of beer. Owing to the large volume he consumes, the beer drinker absorbs more alcohol than the whiskey drinker. Moreover the tremendous amount of liquid which he gulps down enlarges his stomach and increases his girth. Some people seem to thrive on beer but they usually acquire enormous bellies.’’’

“And what,” I asked, “is your attitude toward smoking?”

Mr. Tesla's defense of alcohol as against coffee and tea had left me somewhat startled. However, it seems that Tesla is no friend of the weed.


‘‘‘I have smoked a good deal, but when I was about twenty I gave a promise to stop, and smoked my last cigar. Smoking stimulates thought on general subjects; but is an enemy to concentration. The most stimulating activity, to my mind, is walking. I walk never less than ten miles a day. This has kept me in good health, but it may in the end lead to my destruction, because I am a confirmed jay-walker.


‘‘‘My exercise,’’’ Tesla continued, ‘‘‘is not confined to my ten-mile walk. I bathe every day and I exercise in my bath. I have acquired great proficiency in these exercises. I have, in some respects, the agility of a baby. There is hardly a movement I cannot make except I cannot kiss my elbow. I can clamp a piece of paper between my shoulder blades and hold it so firmly that no one can remove it without tearing it off.’’’

“It seems curious,” I said, “that you, who are one of the master minds in electricity, do not use it to recharge your own energies.”

‘‘‘Why, of course I do,’’’ Tesla replied.

‘‘‘Many years ago I discovered the therapeutic uses of electricity, especially of the high-frequency current. I announced my discovery in this field in 1891.


‘‘‘I believe in what may be called a waterless bath, by which 1 mean charging of the body to a very high electric potential. It is a bath of fire that rebuilds, rejuvenates, cleans, and exhilarates. It carries off instantly all dust, impurities and microbes, and stimulates the tips of the nerves. While in the bath the body is surrounded by a halo of light, plainly visible in the dark. I am now working on an apparatus which will make this electric bath safe and economically possible, even for a person of average means.’’’

Tesla, unlike Edison and Marconi, is a bachelor. He prefers to be wedded to science. It seemed all the more important to discover his attitude on sex — sex, the most electrifying factor in the lives of most men. Tesla did not evade the question.


‘‘‘I recognize the importance that sex plays in the life of man. Nature has made its attraction irresistible to insure the perpetuity of the race. As for myself, I have found that the thinker is confronted with the problem of perpetuating either the species or the mind. It is almost impossible, at least in certain realms of high endeavor, to do both. This has been recognized by the Hindus, whose adepts practice complete sexual abstinence, and by many of the great religions.

‘‘‘Before I produced the rotating magnetic field, I concentrated all my powers upon my experiment. The strain would have killed a hundred oxen. I certainly could not have survived it if I had permitted my energies to be diverted into the channels of sex.’’’

“You have not,” I remarked, “told me the part played in your life by that great restorer of energy — sleep.” I asked this with malice aforethought, because I remembered that Tesla's great rival, Edison, had always claimed that he was able to get along with only a few hours of sleep.

‘‘‘I should say,’’’ Tesla replied, ‘‘‘that a man who performs hard physical labor needs seven to eight hours of rest to recuperate, not necessarily eight hours of sleep. I myself sleep only two hours out of twenty-four. This does not mean that I may not assume a recumbent position, but my mind continues to work out its problems. I have often, during such apparent periods of rest, worked out my most difficult problems. In my younger days, I probably slept three to four hours.

‘‘‘When I sleep, I sleep profoundly. To sleep deeply, profoundly, is an art like deep breathing that must be learned. It is one of the secrets of the East. I think that I have discovered the secret. After a profound sleep, no matter how short, I feel so much refreshed that even now, when I am near eighty, I must perform gymnastic feats to subdue my new-gained vitality.’’’

Edison, I interjected, “declared that he could get along on two or three hours of sleep.”


Tesla's eyes twinkled merrily.


‘‘‘People sometimes deceive themselves,’’’ he said. ‘‘‘Edison thought that he slept very little. As a matter of fact, I never knew anyone who slept as much as Edison. I have often seen him put his feet on the table in his laboratory and sleep for three or four hours. Then he would get up and work a little, only to take another nap of three or four hours. Naturally he did not have much need for sleep when the day was over.’’’


“You would not,” I remarked, “recommend two hours of sleep or the extreme indulgence in brandy to other men.”


‘‘‘It is possible,’’’ Tesla replied, shrugging his shoulders, ‘‘‘that my scheme of life may not help others unless it is modified in accordance with one's specific requirements, but it has kept in gear for seventy-eight years the machine which is Nikola Tesla.’’’

         Inventor Says Light and
         Particles do Not Travel
           at the Same Speed.
      
            by Nikola Tesla

         New York Herald Tribune
    March 3rd, 1935 Page number(s): A6

The Herald Tribune of January 20, 1935, contained a report relating to some observations of cosmic rays made by Dr. Werner Kolhoester, director of the Observatory of Potsdam, in connection with the outburst of Nova Herculis (the "new" star) noted in December of last year. I had intended to offer a few words of comment upon the same at that time, but thought it advisable to read first the original statement published in the Supplement of the "Berliner Tageblatt" of January 20, 1935, which has been forwarded to me through the courtesy of the German Consulate.

    Would Confirm His Theory
This news item has interested me, as the results announced, if valid, would be another confirmation of my theory of cosmic rays advanced in 1896 according to which these radiations can only emanate from such vast and incandescent heavenly bodies as our sun, placed in an almost perfect vacuum and charged to tremendous potentials, sufficient for imparting to minute similarly electrified particles immense speeds and energies by electrostatic repulsion. I have proved this theory rigorously by experiments and deductions, but had I not done so, it would still be established as a scientific truth, for there is no force or effect produced in the universe which, even if amplified millions of times, could account for the cosmic phenomena discovered by me.

Now, a Nova, in its phase of greatest brightness and transcending temperature at the surface, is a generator of cosmic rays incomparably more powerful than our sun. But while this is unquestionably true, the findings of the German radiologist are open to serious objections.

In the first place, calculation conformable to my theory shows that in order to cause an increase in the intensity of the rays of the order found, the surface temperature of the star, assuming its distance 1,200 light years, could not have been much less than 5,000,000 degrees centigrade. Such a high value is extremely improbable although in a Nova, in which radiation of heat from the inside is greatly facilitated by expansion, the difference in the temperatures of the central and peripheral parts may not be very great.

Then, again, the increase recorded, amounting to about 1 percent of the intensity of cosmic rays emitted by our sun, is too small for drawing a reliable conclusion in view of the influence of weather conditions and other disturbing causes. It must also be borne in mind that the coincidence method adopted is far from being accurate.

There exists, however, an element of incertitude which in itself is sufficient to invalidate completely the results obtained and of which Dr. Kolhoerster does not seem to have thought. Light is a wave motion of definite velocity, determined by the elastic force and density of the medium. Cosmic rays are particles of matter, the speed of which depends on the propelling force and mass and may be much smaller or greater than that of light.

    Difference in Speeds
Consequently, there can be no concordance in the phases of the two disturbances at the place of observation. The cosmic rays, generated during the maximum brightness of the star, may reach the place many centuries sooner or later than the light, according to their speed. It thus appears that the results announced cannot have been due to Nova Herculis. Considering further the briefness and small number of star outburts, it is evident that the Novae cannot contribute appreciably to the steady rain of cosmic particles pouring upon the earth from the countless suns of the universe.

*** THE NEW ART OF PROJECTING CONCENTRATED NON-DISPERSIVE ENERGY THROUGH NATURAL MEDIA ***

System of Particle Acceleration for Use in National Defense
Circa May 16th, 1935

Briefly Exposed

by NIKOLA TESLA


The advances described are the result of my research carried on for many years with the chief object of transmitting electrical energy to great distances.

----

The first important practical realization of these efforts was the alternating current power system now in universal use.

I then turned my attention to wireless transmission and was fortunate enough to achieve similar success in this fruitful field, my discoveries and inventions being employed throughout the world.

In the course of this work, I mastered the technique of high potentials sufficiently for enabling me to construct and operate, in 1899, a wireless transmitter developing up to twenty million volts.

----

Some time before I contemplated the possibility of transmitting such high tension currents over a narrow beam of radiant energy ionizing the air and rendering it, in measure, conductive. After preliminary laboratory experiments, I made tests on a large scale with the transmitter referred to and a beam of ultra-violet rays of great energy in an attempt to conduct the current to the high rarefied strata of the air and thus create an auroral such as might be utilized for illumination, especially of oceans at night.

I found that there was some virtue in the principal but the results did not justify the hope of important practical applications although, some years later, several inventors claimed to have produced a "death ray" in this manner. While the published reports to this effect were entirely unfounded, I believe that with the new transmitter to be built, this and many other wonders will be achieved.

Much time was devoted by me to the transmission of radiant energy, in various forms, by reflectors and I perfected means for increasing enormously the intensity of the effects, but was baffled in all my efforts to materially reduce dispersion and became fully convinced that this handicap could only be overcome by conveying the power through the medium of small particles projected, at prodigious velocity, from the transmitter.

----

Electro-static repulsion was the only means to this end and apparatus of stupendous force would have to be developed, but granted that sufficient speed and energy could be realized with a single row of minute bodies then there would be no dispersion whatever even at great distance. Since the cross section of the carriers might be reduced to almost microscopic dimensions an immense concentration of energy, irrespective of distance, could be attained.

When I undertook to carry out this plan in practice, the difficulties seemed insurmountable. In the first place, a closed vacuum tube could not be employed as no window could withstand the force of the impact.

This made it absolutely necessary to project the particles in free air which meant that each could hold only an insignificant charge. Thus, no matter how high the potential of the terminal, the force of repulsion would be necessarily too small for the purpose contemplated…


But by the application of my discoveries and inventions it is possible to increase the force of repulsion more than a million times and what was heretofore impossible, is rendered easy of accomplishment. 

----

🐇 The successful carrying out of the plan involves a number of more or less important improvements but the principal among these include the following:

1. A new form of high vacuum tube open to the atmosphere.

2. Provisions for imparting to a minute particle an extremely high charge.

3. A new terminal of relatively small dimensions and enormous potential.

4. An electro-static generator on a new principle and of very great power.

----

Fig. 1
Illustrating open vacuum tube.


These devices and methods of operation will be explained by reference to the attached drawings in which Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 represent forms of the new open tube.


In Fig. 1, the device consists of an inner cylindrical conduit 1,

cemented to a metallic socket 3,

and an outer conduit 2,

which is tightly screwed to the socket by a nut 4,

and has on the open side a taper with a cylindrical end 9,

of the same inside diameter as conduit 1.


The socket 3, is bored out to provide a large chamber around the inner conduit and carries a pipe 7,

through which thoroughly desiccated air or other gas under suitable pressure is supplied.


The open end of the inner and the tapering part of the outer conduit are ground to form an expanding nozzle 8,

through which the air escapes into the atmosphere thereby creating a high vacuum in the inner conduit.


The socket 3 has a small central hole

and is provided with an inside extension 5, and a threaded outside projection 6,

the latter serving for connection to a container supplying automatically suitable particles or material for same

while the former fulfill the purpose of charging them as they emerge from the hole.


The conduit 1 and 2, may be made of fused quartz, pyrex glass or other refractory material

and it is obviously desirable that all the parts of the apparatus have small and nearly equal coefficients of thermal expansion

especially when the working medium, which might also be superheated steam, is at an elevated temperature.

--

It will be observed that in this tube I do away with the solid wall or window indispensable in all types heretofore employed,

producing the high vacuum required and preventing the inrush of the air by a gaseous jet of high velocity.

Evidently, to secure this result, the dynamic pressure of the jet must be at least equal to the external static pressure.


Expressed in symbols:


V²w/2g = P


Assuming equality:


V = √2g P/w


in which equation V is the speed of the jet at its entrance to channel 8 in meters,

g the acceleration of gravity likewise in meters,

P the external pressure in kilograms per square meter

and w the normal weight of the air in kilograms per cubic meter.


Now


g = 9.81 meters

P = 10332.9 kilograms

w = 1.2929 kilograms


These values give


V = 396 meters


Some allowance should be made for the frictional loss in the nozzle and the outlet channel and also for the deflection of the jet.


For most purposes, the velocity need not be much greater,

but as the degree of rarefaction depends on the square of V,

it is desirable to obtain as high a value as practicable.


Usually, vacuums obtained by a mercury vapor pump are considered very high.


In those, the velocity is only 280 meters per second

but the vapor is 6.9 times heavier than air.

Therefore to get the same vacuum in the air jet,

its speed should be 280 x [6.9]1/2 = 735 meters.


With a working medium at high temperature and pressure,

both within practicable limits, this value can be attained and even exceeded.


Thus, a gaseous jet of very high velocity affords a means for closing the end of the tube,

more perfectly than any window that can be made

while at the same time permitting and facilitating the exit of the particles. 

--

Fig. 2
Showing a modified form of open vacuum tube.

Referring to fig. 2., it shows schematically a modified form of my tube intended for various scientific and practical uses when it may be preferable or necessary not to discharge the jet through the open end.

The construction of the device will be easily understood in view of the foregoing description like parts being similarly designated.

A cylindrical conduit 1, is provided as in fig. 1,

but the outer cone is replaced by a block 2, of lava or other insulating material shaped as indicated and firmly cemented to the conduit 1,

which is hermetically joined by a nut 4, to a metallic plug 3, having a central hole, and extensions 3 and 6, serving the purpose stated above.

The working fluid, as compressed desiccated air, is supplied by means of a pipe 7,

to a large annular space around conduit 1, and escapes through an expanding nozzle 8,

formed by the tapering part of the block and the end of the conduit,

into a chamber connected by a pipe 10, to a vacuum pump of large capacity — not shown on the drawing —

for carrying off not only the air issuing from the nozzle

but also that rushing in from the outside through the open end 9.

In order to minimize the volume of the latter,

I avail myself of an invention of mine known as the "valvular conduit" by providing the wall of the open end 9, with recesses as indicated giving rise to whirls and eddies which use up some of the energy of the stream and reduce its velocity.

In this way, a pressure of about 100 millimeters of mercury can be readily maintained in the chamber increasing greatly the expansion ration of the air and its speed through the nozzle.

----

It is hardly necessary to remark that my open vacuum tubes require mechanical power for operation which may range from 10 to 20 h.p., but this drawback is insignificant when considering the important advantages they offer and I anticipate that they will be extensively employed.

----

It remains to be explained how such a tube is utilized for imparting to a particle to be projected a very great charge.


Imagine that the small spherical body be placed in a nearly perfect vacuum and electrically connected to the large sphere forming the high potential terminal of the transmitter.


By virtue of the connection,

the small sphere will then be at the potential of the large one no matter what its distance from the same

but the quantity of electricity stored on the small sphere will vary greatly with the distance

and be proportionate to the difference of its potential and that of the adjacent medium.


If the small sphere is very close to the large one,

this difference will be insignificant and so to the charge;

but if the small sphere is at a great distance from the large one where the potential imparted by the same to the medium approximates zero,

the quantity of electricity stored on the small one will be relatively enormous and equal to Qr/R.


To illustrate, if r = 1/100 e.s. and R = 1000 e.s. and Q = 108 e.s. units, as before assumed,

then Q =1000 e.s. units which is a hundred thousand times more than previously obtainable.


At a distance 2R from the center of the terminal,

at which the difference between the potential of the small sphere and the adjacent medium will be half of the total, or 15,000,000 volts,

Q will be 500 e.s. units

and from theoretical considerations, it appears that the best results will be secured if the particle is charged in high vacuum at that distance.


It can be accomplished all the more easily the smaller the radius of the terminal

and this is one of the reasons why my improvement,

illustrated in Fig. 3, is of great practical importance.


Fig. 3
New terminal for exceedingly high potentials.


As will appear from the inspection of the drawing,

the spherical frame of the terminal is equipped with devices,

one of which is shown in the enlarged view below and comprises a bulb 2,

of glass or other insulating material

and an electrode of thin sheet suitable rounded.

The latter is joined by a supporting wire to a metallic socket adapted for fastening to the frame 1, by means of nut 3.


The bulb is exhausted to the very highest vacuum obtainable

and the electrode can be charged to an immense density.


Thus, it is made possible to raise the potential of the terminal to any value desired,

so to speak, without limit,

and the usual losses are avoided.

I am confident that as much as one hundred million volts will be reached with such a transmitter providing a tool on inestimable value for practical purposes as well as scientific research.

----
Fig. 4
Schematic illustration of new high potential generator.


Perhaps the most important of these inventions is the new high potential electro-static generator,

schematically represented in Fig. 4,

which is provided with my improved terminal consisting of a spherical metallic frame 1,

with attachments 2, adapted to be fastened to the former by nuts 3, as above described.


The terminal has a platform 4,

in the interior of the frame intended for supporting machinery, instruments and observers,

and is carried to a suitable elevation on insulating columns omitted from the drawing for the sake of simplicity.


To energize the terminal, air under pressure is driven at high speed through a hermetically closed channel comprising a turbo compressor 5,

with intake and outlet connections,

conduits 7 and 8, special fittings 9 and 10,and a short pipe 11.


The conduits 7 and 8, are preferably composed of pieces of glazed porcelain bolted tightly together, the joints being made airtight by suitable packing and are corrugated on the outside to minimize electrical leakage. The fittings 9 and 10 and pipe 11, may also be of the same kind of material.


The air before entering and after leaving the compressor,

as well as all apparatus within the airtight enclosure 6,

is effectively cooled and maintained at a constant temperature by means as ordinarily employed which was not thought necessary to illustrate.

----

The operation of the machine will be understood most readily by likening the moving column of air to a running belt.

----

When the air, leaving the compressor, reaches the device 12, containing discharge points electrified by a direct current of high tension,

it is ionized and the charge imparted to it is carried upward to the special fitting 9, where it is drawn off by sucking points and charges the terminal.


On the return to the compressor the air passes through special fitting 10, where it receives electricity of the opposite sign conveying it to the device 13, and from there to the ground.


These actions are repeated with great rapidity. The generator can be made self-exciting by suitable connections.

----

For several reasons, I estimate that a machine as described will have an output of many times greater than a belt generator of the same size and, besides, it has several other important construction and operative advantages.

----

Fig. 5
Spherical terminal and an open vacuum tube for projecting particles.


To give an approximate estimate of performance, reference is made to diagram in Fig. 5,

representing a spherical terminal and an open vacuum tube for projecting particles.


Suppose that d be the distance from the center o at which a particle of radius r = 1/100 c.m. is charged in vacuum to the potential of the terminal, as before explained,

and that D is the distance from center O at which the particle leaves the vacuous space,

then,

in passing through the distance D - d it will be accelerated to a velocity

V₁ = √2Qq (D-d) / md D centimeters per second.

----

In its transit from distance 

D to a very much greater distance

an additional velocity of

V₂ = √2Qq' / m D centimeters per second

q' being, theoretically, smaller than q.


But I have found that although the particle in contact with air is neutralized rapidly yet, on account of its small surface, magnitude of the charge and prodigious speed, a very great distance is traversed without material reduction of the charge so that, without appreciable error, q' may be considered equal to q.


Thus, the total velocity attained will be

V = V₁+V₂ = √2Qq (D-d) / md D + √2Qq' / m D centimeters per second

in which expression Q and q are in e.s. units, D and d in centimeters and m the mass of the particle in grams. 


But the calculation may be simplified, for if the charge is virtually constant through a great distance, the velocity finally attained will be

V = √2Qq / md centimeters per second

----

Assume now that the terminal is equivalent to a sphere of radius R = 250 centimeters

which heretofore could only be charged to a potential of 100 x 250 = 25,000 e.s. units or 7,500,000 volts but,

by taking advantage of my improvements, can be readily charged to 2 x 105 e.s. units or 6 x 107 volts

in which case the quantity of electricity stored will be Q = 2 x 105 x 250 = 5 x 107 e.s. units.


If, for best effect, the particle is charged in vacuum at a distance d = 2R = 500 centimeters

where the difference between its potential and adjacent medium is 3 x 107 volts or 105 e.s. units,

then q/r = 105 and q = 105 = 1000 e.s. units.


The particle will have a volume of 4π/3 x 106 cubic centimeters

and if it be tungsten,

it will weigh about 4π x 18/3 x 106 = 7686/1011 gram.


Substituting these values


V = √2 x 5 x 107 x 1000 x 10¹¹ / 1000 x 7686 x 500

= 1,613,000 centimeters or 16,130 meters per second.


This finding may be checked by using the relation between the joule's equivalent and the kinetic energy.


Here the joules are 3 x 10⁷ x 1000 / 3 x 10⁹ = 10

and approximately equal to 106 gram-centimeters.


Consequently,


mV² / 2 = 10⁶
V² = 2 x 10⁶ x 10¹¹ / 7686 and
V = 1,613,000 centimeters or 16,130 meters


as found above by my formula which is always applicable while the latter rule is not.


Since a joule is equivalent to about 10,000 gram-centimeters,

the kinetic energy is equal to 10⁵ gram-centimeters or 1 kilogram-meter.

----

In order to determine the probable trajectory the air resistance encountered by the particle has to be estimated from practical data and theoretical consideration.


Very extensive ballistic tests by French experts have established conclusively

that up to a velocity of 400 meters per second, the resistance increases as the square of the speed

but from there on, to the highest velocities attained, the increase is directly proportional to the speed.


On the other hand, it has been found in tests with rifles that an ordinary bullet,

8 millimeters in diameter and three times as long,

fired at 400 meters per second,

encounters a mean resistance of about 0.02 kilogram and from these facts,

it can be inferred that the average resistance of the particle at the maximum speed V might be of the order of 1/64,000 of a kilogram

and if so, the trajectory should be approximately 64,000 meters or 64 kilometers.


Obviously, resistance data cannot be accurate,

but as the mechanical effects can be increased many times,

there should be no difficulty in securing the practically required range with a transmitter as described.


In all probability, when the technique is perfected, results will be obtained which are thought impossible at present.


Such a particle,

notwithstanding its minute volume of 1/250,000 cubic centimeter,

would be very destructive.


It would pierce the usual protecting covering of aeroplanes,

put machinery out of commission

and ignite fuel and explosives.


To combatants, it would be deadly at any distance well within its full range.


Projected almost simultaneously in great numbers,

the particles would produce intense heating effects.


In action, against aeroplanes, the range would be very much greater on account of the smaller density of the air.

--

Evidently, the smaller the particles, the greater will be their speed.


For instance, if r = 1/10,000 centimeter,

a velocity of 160,000 meters per second will be attained.

An enormous increase in speed and range would be secured with particles of a diameter smaller than 800 times the molecular diameter.

----

It is important to devise a thoroughly practical and simple means for supplying particles

and I have invented two which seem to meet this requirement.

--

One is to feed tungsten or other wire from a spool in a closed container joined hermetically to the projector,

the rotation of the spool being under control of the operator.

Using wire 2/100 centimeters in diameter,

twenty cubic centimeters of the same would provide material for 5,000,000 particles.

--

The other device consists of a closed container fixed to the projector

and filled with mercury which can be expanded by external and controllable application of heat

and forced, under great pressure, through a minute hole in the extreme end of the extension

reaching to the distance d as before illustrated and explained.

-

The droplet torn off and projected would have the hardness of steel owing to the great capillary pressure.

-

If mercury be used for the purpose, this means is ideally simple and cheap.

Dr. Nikola Tesla, scientist and seer whose discoveries in the fields of polyphase electrical current and wireless place him in the front rank or modern inventors, refused yesterday to be awed by the record speed achievement of the French liner Normandie in crossing the Atlantic in 4 days 11 hours 42 minutes and predicted that enormous ships would cross the ocean at far greater speeds by means of a high-tension current projected from power plants on shore to vessels at sea through the upper reaches of the atmosphere.
In his room at the Hotel New Yorker, dressed in a blue bathrobe, blue socks and red slippers, Dr. Tesla expounded the principles of his fabulous method of power transmission — a method which he has been developing at irregular intervals from as far back as 1897. The virtues of stratosphere transmission, he said, lay not only in its potential increase of a vessel's speed but also in its power to eliminate the dangers of nocturnal navigation.

In short, high-tension currents of electricity passing through the stratosphere would light the sky and to a degree turn night into day. With power plants stationed at intermediate posts such as upon the Azores and Bermuda, vessels could cross the Atlantic, propelled and safeguarded at the same time by electricity generated ashore. There would no longer be danger of boiler explosions nor hazards of collisions at sea. Even on moonless, cloudy nights, there still would gleam overhead the faint rays of surging electrical currents, so strong that pilots would be able to distinguish objects miles away.

Normandie Uses U.S. Cruiser System
Dr. Tesla, a tall, slender man with straight silvery hair, lean features and bright blue eyes that belie his seventy-eight years, prefaced his prophecies by pointing out that the Normandie's system of power generation and application was not new — but one which had been adopted long ago in some of the United States cruisers. The principle is one of his own invention.

‘‘‘The Normandie,’’’ he said, ‘‘‘employs an ‘electric drive’ in which turbines drive generators and generators supply the current to independent motors. In this case the turbines are driven by steam, the generators are of the three-phase type and the motors are of the induction type.[sic]

‘‘‘In many respects the machinery installed on the United States cruisers by former Secretary Josephus Daniels is more remarkable than that in the Normandie on account or the limitations of available space. Moreover, while the Normandie develops only 160,000 horsepower, the cruisers each develop 185,000 horsepower. These cruisers employ the most remarkable engine plants in the world, and I believe that this drive would not have been employed on the Normandie had it not been for the pioneering work done in the United States.[sic]

‘‘‘In view of the adoption on such a large scale of these inventions of mine, it is interesting to recall that I was violently attacked only a few years ago by a professor of marine engineering at Columbia, who claimed the electrical drive was not feasible and that it was a folly to undertake it.[sic]

‘‘‘However splendid the machinery in the Normandie might be, the time is not distant when we will have much simpler and better means of propulsion.’’’

    Cites His Force Beam as One Way
Here Dr. Tesla recalled the possibilities of his force beam of particles which he announced last year as a potential defensive weapon of great value. One of its aspects is a death ray capable of destroying airplanes and armies. Another is a means of power transmission which could be used to relay immense voltages of power over distances limited only by the curvature of the earth.


The difficulties inherent in using this method as a means of propulsion for oceangoing ships, however, were seen by Dr. Tesla to lie in the necessity of vast outlays of capital and concerted harmonious endeavor by the chief nations of the world. The latter, he said, would be impossible to achieve at the present time. A third difficulty would be the task of keeping a ship at sea constantly in touch with a threadlike beam of particles from ashore.


Dr. Tesla, therefore, suggested that his other scheme, of stratosphere transmission of electricity, would be a far more feasible means of marine propulsion. The principles of the two plans are entirely distinct. The force beam is a thin barrage of tiny particles discharged at tremendous velocities from a kind of electrical gun. The other Invention, which he has not hitherto discussed publicly, is of transmitting high tension currents through the upper air, and receiving them by means of a vertical ionizing beam which would be a sort of invisible electrode. He discussed this yesterday:


    Started New Idea in 1897
‘‘‘There is a method of conveying great power to ships at sea which would be able to propel them across oceans at high speed.  This method I conceived between 1897 and 1899, and in Colorado Springs in 1899.  I made experiments along this line on a large scale.


‘‘‘The principle is this: A ray of great ionizing power is used to give to the atmosphere great powers of conduction.  A high tension current of 10,000,000 to 12,000,000 volts is then passed along this ray to the upper strata of the air, which strata can be broken down very readily and will conduct electricity very well.[sic]

‘‘‘A ship would have to have equipment for producing a similar ionizing ray.  The current which has passed through the stratosphere will strike this ray, travel down it and pass into the engines which propel the ship.[sic]

    Pet Scheme to Light Ocean
‘‘‘I will confess that I was disappointed when I first made tests along this line on a large scale.  They did not yield practical results.  At the time I used about 8,000,000 to 12,000,000 volts of electricity.  As a source of ionizing rays I employed a powerful arc reflected up into the sky.  At the time I was trying only to connect a high tension current and the upper strata of the air, because my pet scheme for years has been to light the ocean at night.[sic]


‘‘‘However, since 1902 I have made many improvements in my method which I know now will assure success.  A power plant upon the Azores, for instance, could send a current up into the stratosphere and illuminate the sky sufficiently for pilots to discern objects upon the ocean at a safe distance.’’’

Dr. Tesla said that he was working constantly every day to perfect his force beam, his method of stratosphere transmission of power, and a number of other inventions the nature of which he was not ready to disclose.  When it was called to his attention that he was working pretty hard for a man who would be seventy-nine years old next month, he replied:


  ‘‘‘Why, I'm young I never think of my age.  Really, you know, I'm just a youngster.🐇’’’

Nikola Tesla, the man with seven hundred basic patents to his credit, who startled the world on a number of occasions in the past by achieving what others had regarded as impossible, including the large-scale generation and distribution of alternating current, yesterday treated the combined metropolitan press to a personally conducted tour of the labyrinthine laboratory of his fertile mind.

It was his seventy-ninth birthday anniversary, and, in keeping with his custom of past years, he made the day an occasion for revealing some of the latest products of his brain in the line of discovery, a field in which he rivaled and sometimes surpassed Edison during the golden era of electrical invention.

He confined himself yesterday to three of his startling adventures in the realm of theoretical and practical science. One of these, he said, ‘‘‘would appear almost preposterous.’’’ The second, he said with true candor, ‘‘‘would be considered absolutely impossible by any competent electrical engineer.’’’ 🐇The third would knock the props out from under the theory of relativity, he said, but in this case also he expressed his doubt that the modern generation of scientists would take his challenge seriously🐇.


    Cites Cosmic Ray Proof.
He described relativity as ‘‘‘a beggar wrapped in purple whom ignorant people take for a king.’’’ In support of his statement he cited a number of experiments he had conducted, he said, as far back as 1896 on the cosmic ray. He has measured cosmic ray velocities from Antarus, he said, which he found to be fifty times greater than the speed of light, thus demolishing, he contended, one of the basic pillars of the structure of relativity, according to which there can be no speed greater than that of light.


Mr. Tesla treated the press, reporters, camera men, news and sound reel representatives, about thirty in number, to a gourmet's luncheon in a private dining room at the Hotel New Yorker, where he has been making his home during the past two years. Mr. Tesla sat at the head of the table and talked while the reporters and camera men feasted on his bounty. He disdained each and every dish that was brought to him, not even touching his glass of water.

Toward the end of the luncheon he absented himself for a while and came back with a bottle containing a small quantity of pasteurized milk. This he poured in a silver chafing dish and heated to the proper temperature. Then came the surprise of the day — a birthday cake with a lone candle, a token of esteem by the management of the New Yorker to its distinguished bachelor guest.

    His Greatest Achievement.
One of the subjects, which he hoped, he said, will come to be recognized as his ‘‘‘greatest achievement in the field of engineering.’’’ was, he said, the perfection by him of ‘‘‘an apparatus by which mechanical energy can be transmitted to any part of the terrestrial globe.’’’
🐇
This apparatus, he said, will have at least four practical possibilities. It will give the world a new means of unfailing communication; it will provide a new and by far the safest means for guiding ships at sea and into port; it will furnish a certain divining rod for locating ore deposits of any kind under the surface of the earth; and finally, it will furnish scientists with a means for laying bare the physical conditions of the earth, and will enable them to determine all of the earth's physical constants.
🐇
He called this discovery ‘‘‘tele-geodynamics,’’’ motion of earth-forces at a distance. It is of this, he said, that it would ‘‘‘appear almost preposterous.’’’ The apparatus, he added, is ‘‘‘ideally simple,’’’ consisting of a stationary part and a cylinder of fine steel ‘‘‘floating’’’ in air. He has found means, he said, of ‘‘‘impressing upon the floating part powerful impulses which react on the stationary part, and through the latter to transmit energy through the earth.’’’ To do this he has ‘‘‘found a new amplifier for a known type of energy,’’’ and the ‘‘‘purpose is to produce impulses through the earth and then pick them up whenever needed.’’’
🐇
The second invention, which, he said, ‘‘‘will be considered absolutely impossible by any competent electrical engineer,’’’ was described by him as a new method and apparatus for producing direct current without a commutator, ‘‘‘something that has been considered impossible since the days of Faraday.’’’ ‘‘‘Incredible as it seems,’’’ he said, ‘‘‘I have found a solution for this old problem.’’’


Cosmic rays, he asserted, he found are produced by the force of ‘‘‘electrostatic repulsion’’’; they consist of powerfully charged positive particles which come to us from the sun and other suns in the universe. He determined, ‘‘‘after experimentation,’’’ he added, that the sun is charged ‘‘‘with an electric potential of approximately 215,000,000,000 volts, while the electric charge stored in the sun amounted to approximately 50,000,000,000,000,000,000 electrostatic units.’’’


The theory of relativity he described as ‘‘‘a mass of error and deceptive ideas violently opposed to the teachings of great men of science of the past and even to common sense.’’’

‘‘‘The theory,’’’ he said, ‘‘‘wraps all these errors and fallacies and clothes them in magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king. Its exponents are very brilliant men, but they are metaphysicists rather than scientists. Not a single one of the relativity propositions has been proved.’’’

Could Destroy Empire State Building with Five Pounds of Air Pressure, He Says

July 11th 1935

Nikola Tesla is 79 years old, and he is one of the true geniuses of this time. Nevertheless, twenty-odd newspapermen came away from his Hotel New Yorker birthday party yesterday, which lasted six hours, feeling hesitantly that something was wrong either with the old man's mind or else with their own, for Dr. Tesla, serene in an old-fashioned Prince Albert and courtly in a way that seems to have gone out of this world, announced that: -

1. He had discovered the so-called cosmic ray in 1896, at least five years before any other scientist took it up and twenty years before it became popular among scientists, and he is now convinced that many of the cosmic particles travel fifty times faster than light, some of them 500 times faster.

    Needs No Commutator
2. He has found a way to produce a direct electric current by induction and without the use of a commutator, which is something the experts in electricity have considered impossible for the past hundred years.

3. 🐇He has invented an ‘‘‘absolutely impossible’’’ machine which will impart vibrations to the earth which, with proper receiving apparatus can be picked up anywhere on the earth's surface, and that this mysterious machine will allow scientists to explore the deep interior of the earth, will enable practical geologists to discover gold, coal and petroleum, and at the same time will give ships the means of navigating without compass or sextant🐇.

Dr. Tesla has 600 to 700 patents to his name. He invented the rotary field motor, and is admittedly the seer and father of all modern electrical development. As has been his custom for five years now, he arranged his own birthday party, drank only hot milk as his part of the celebration, and made his announcements with the superb certainty of a man who knew what he was talking about, even if none of his guests did.


    Tells of ‘‘‘Quake’’’


He said, among other things, that he expects to have $100,000,000 within two years, and he revealed that an earthquake which drew police and ambulances to the region of his laboratory at 48 E. Houston St. in 1887 or was the result of a little machine he was experimenting with at that time which ‘‘‘you could put in your overcoat pocket.’’’

The bewildered newspapermen pounced upon this as at least one thing they could understand and ‘‘‘the father of modern electricity’’’ told what had happened as follows:

‘‘‘I was experimenting with vibrations. I had one of my machines going and I wanted to see if I could get it in tune with the vibration of the building. I put it up notch after notch. There was a peculiar cracking sound.[sic?]

‘‘‘I asked my assistants where did the sound come from. They did not know. I put the machine up a few more notches. There was a louder cracking sound. I knew I was approaching the vibration of the steel building. I pushed the machine a little higher.[sic?]

‘‘‘Suddenly all the heavy machinery in the place was flying around. I grabbed a hammer and broke the machine. The building would have been down about our ears in another few minutes. Outside in the street there was pandemonium. The police and ambulances arrived. I told my assistants to say nothing. We told the police it must have been an earthquake. That's all they ever knew about it.’’’


    Watch Out, Mr. Smith


Some shrewd reporter asked Dr. Tesla at this point what he would need to destroy the Empire State Building and the doctor replied: - ‘‘‘Five pounds of air pressure. 🐇 If I attached the proper oscillating machine on a girder that is all the force I would need, five pounds. Vibration will do anything. It would only be necessary to step up the vibrations of the machine to fit the natural vibration of the building and the building would come crashing down. That's why soldiers always break step crossing a bridge.’’’
His early experiments in vibration, he explained, led to his invention of his ‘‘‘Earth vibrating machine’’’. Tall and thin and ascetic face, his eyes sunken but humorous under protruding brows, he was cagey about describing what his new machine is, although he believes it will be ‘‘‘the chief thing of my many inventions posterity will thank me for.’’’

NIKOLA TESLA TELLS HOW HE'D DEFEND ETHIOPIA AGAINST ITALIAN INVASION
Detroit Times
by George Sylvester Viereck
September 22nd, 1935 Page number(s): 3

Dense Tropical Growth Will Frustrate Bombs and Gas Hurled from Airplane.

"What would you do, if you were Emporer[sic?] of Ethiopia?"

This question, addressed to Nikola Tesla, suggested itself to me when I remembered the recent announcement by the discoverer of the rotating electric field, that he had perfected certain inventions by which the weak could protect themselves against the strong.

These inventions, it was claimed, could destroy whole cities and put an attacking fleet of airplanes out of commission at great distance.

Could these means be employed by Ethiopia to hold off Mussolini?

I sought out the inventor in a skyscraper hotel, where he ponders over new scientific devices.

Tesla was deeply absorbed in thought, but his sternness melted and his pale face was illuminated by an understanding smile.

‘‘‘Why do you ask me this question? I bear no ill will against Italians; they have brought forth great men in science, literature and art, and supplied workmen and artisans who have advanced humanity.

‘‘‘This alleviates their contemplated act of piracy. Other nations have done worse. Nations cannot be judged by the same standards as individuals.

‘‘‘If I were the ruler of Ethiopia, I would rigorously utilize every natural advantage of my country to nullify the effectiveness of this superior armament and, above all, to prevent him from staging a sensational air-attack, destructive to the morale of my simple-minded subjects.

    MUST USE THEIR WITS.
‘‘‘As a first and absolutely indispensable measure I would order the complete evacuation of Addis Ababa and all other places of importance without a moment's delay.

I believe that Haile Selassie already contemplates some such course.

‘‘‘I would leave no civilians behind in dealing with Mussolini. Though a man of genius and culture, the Duce has a strain of ferocity in his make-up, which appears in some of his outbursts. Savagely bent upon avenging the crushing Italian defeat at Adowa, Mussolini would command ruthless destruction.

‘‘‘I would scatter my people in the thickly wooded regions and tell them that they must match with cunning what they lack in might to escape annihilation.

‘‘‘Italian air fleets will darken the sky to overawe the population, probably. But will they bomb towns and settlements, deserted and stripped of all things of value? That would be a costly sport. It would incur the scorn and ridicule of the world. If my directions were strictly followed, the Italian airman could never find the Ethiopian in the tropical underbrush.’’’[sic?]

‘‘‘Knowing that the Ethiopians are hidden there, would the Italians not scatter their bombs over their forests?’’’[sic?]

‘‘‘The noise of bombs hurled from airplanes under such conditions would be entirely out of proportion to their destructiveness; they would kill very few people,’’’ Tesla replied with a laugh.

‘‘‘The dense tropical growth is an ideal impediment against gases and bombs and greatly reduces the range of such devices. Remember also that Ethiopia has a surface of 350,000 square miles, and a population of only 10,000,000, or, on the average 25 inhabitants per square mile. Even to clean out an insignificant jungle requires thousands of ordinary bombs.’’’[sic?]

‘‘‘But if the Italians resort to poison gas, what then?’’’[sic?]

    POISON GAS CERTAIN TO FAIL.
‘‘‘Such attacks must fail. It is a common mistake to disregard the character of the terrain in estimating the military value of modern arms.

‘‘‘Weapons that could be used with disastrous results in Europe, will prove futile in Ethiopia. Poison gas is released by bursting bombs or sprinkled from reservoirs. The weight of these gases is insignificant compared with that of the containers and accessories required for their transportation. To provide 1,000 cubic feet of gas, a plane must carry equipment weighing one ton, and 1,000 cubic feet of gas is no more than a drop in a barrel.

‘‘‘If I were the King, I would teach my subjects how to render themselves immune to poison gas. To explain the scheme, I must go back to my young days in Yugoslavia. As a boy I was very fond of running against the wind and observed that in the summer there was a steady breeze from the land covered with vegetation to a desolate region, barren of growth and strewn with rocks.

[sic?]"'Why does the wind always blow that way?’’’ I asked my mother. ‘Because God has willed it so, my boy.' 'But why has God willed it so?' My curiosity was not satisfied until I acquired some knowledge of physics and mechanics.

‘‘‘Then I understood that the bleak region exposed to the direct glare of the sun became very hot. The expanded air rose, reducing the static pressure. Then, the cooler and denser air from the surrounding country rushed in, to be in turn heated and caused to rise.

    PREVAILING WINDS DISPEL GASES.
‘‘‘In Ethiopia, where the thermometer registers as much as 140 degrees in the shade the exposed regions attain scorching heat and the ensuing air-current is swift and of large volume.

‘‘‘Travelers, noting the prevalence of winds, have not attached any significance to them. Yet, here lies the salvation of Ethiopia. These winds are of supreme importance in gas war. They dilute the gases very greatly and quickly and at the same time supply the vivifying oxygen.

‘‘‘If I were Haile Selassie, I would station my subjects behind natural or artificial barriers sheltering them from the wind. The gas, released in front of them, will be rendered innocuous, because it will be carried off by the wind from which they are protected. The gas released behind them will be extremely diluted. Stream-ing past the barrier, it will cause little harm.

‘‘‘Perhaps my suggesting this remedy in my wholly hypothetical role, I may be rendering a service to both combatants.

‘‘‘But the Italians have been preparing long for this war; they may spring surprises. It was reported that their chemists have produced a powder which will burn the feet of the Ethiopians and put them out of combat.

‘‘‘That must be the proposition of a practical joker or an ignoramus. it would not be possible to manufacture 1 percent of the powder necessary for this purpose. If a limited quantity were sprinkled on the roads and pathways, the Ethiopians would soon find out and beware.

‘‘‘In my opinion the Italians will be wise to abstain from the use of poison in any form. The natives could retaliate by poisoning all wells. This kind of warfare could not fail to prove a calamity; it would bring about a holocaust among the animals. Their putrifying bodies would bring on pestilence. Water would carry the germ-infection far and wide.

‘‘‘No, I do not think that the Ethiopians will be in danger from such devices. The airplane will be of value only in open battle and for scouting purposes. It is not a peril to the Ethiopians.

‘‘‘Their greatest peril is their own impetuosity. If they permit themselves to be detected and enveloped, if they do not confine themselves entirely to guerrilla tactics, the Italians will smash them.’’’[sic?]

"Have you thought of tanks? How would you meet that menace?"

‘‘‘I admit, the task is not easy. The modern tank may be compared to the rhinoceros in the days when no bullet could pierce its hide. The heavy armor of the vehicle protects it from guns of considerable calibre.

    MERCURIC FULMINATE TO PIERCE TANKS.
‘‘‘But this would not discourage me, if I were the lion of Judah. Under my guidance and the pressure of necessity my few mechanical and chemical experts would quickly perfect an efficient defense - possibly rifles of large bore, adapted to fire charges of mercuric fulminate.

‘‘‘This is an extraordinarily powerful explosive. The extreme suddenness of its detonation is such that, even if unconfined, it will punch a hole in a thick steel plate.

‘‘‘The chief difficulty is to prevent premature explosion of the gun barrel. I think this could be overcome by an elastic resistance and slow acceleration, which is practicable as the range can be short.

‘‘‘The charges exploding in contact with the tank would put the propelling engines and machine gun equipment out of order. My Ethiopians, sallying forth from ambush, would do the rest.’’’[sic?]

"What will be the outcome of the war - if it comes to pass?"

‘‘‘This question is easily answered. The Ethiopians must hide in the day and strike in the dark. In doing so, they can prevent the aggressors from achieving the important military results during the present dry season. When the rain comes again, their battle will be half won.

    ITALIANS ALWAYS POOR COLONIZERS.
‘‘‘But we are dealing with a hypothesis. I am still convinced that Mussolini will not dare to embark upon a large-scale invasion of Ethiopia. The price he must pay in equipment and men is too great. He must envisage disastrous consequences to Italy, even in case of victory,[sic?]

‘‘‘Should Ethiopia be conquered, it would prove a cancer eating away the substance of Italy. The Italians have never been successful colonizers.

‘‘‘I perceive more and more clearly that Mussolini is making bold gestures to attain valuable concessions through the mediation of the Peace Conference.

‘‘‘Holding over the heads of the spineless League of Nations, like a sword of Damocles, the threat of another World War more frightful than the first, he has succeeded in scaring its members, so that they are making ready to deal unfairly with a nation whose only offense is its weakness - a nation that existed before Romulus and Remus were born and maintained its independence for over three thousand years.

‘‘‘No matter what compromises may be adopted the Ethiopians will rather die than surrender their independence; hence, whether the issue be peace or war, there is much trouble ahead.’’’[sic?]

🗞️ — A MACHINE TO END WAR — 🗞️
A Famous Inventor, Picturing Life 100 Years from Now, Reveals an Astounding Scientific
Venture Which He Believes Will Change the Course of History

by Nikola Tesla
as told to George Sylvester Viereck
Liberty
February 9th, 1937 Page number(s): 5-7


Tesla. '''It seems,''' he says, '''that I have always been ahead of my time.'''


Editor's Note: Nikola Tesla, now in his seventy-eighth year, has been called the father of radio, television, power transmission, the induction motor, and the robot, and the discoverer of the cosmic ray. Recently he has announced a heretofore unknown source of energy present everywhere in unlimited amounts, and he is now working upon a device which he believes will make war impracticable.

Tesla and Edison have often been represented as rivals. They were rivals, to a certain extent, in the battle between the alternating and direct current in which Tesla championed the former. He won; the great power plants at Niagara Falls and elsewhere are founded on the Tesla system. Otherwise the two men were merely opposites. Edison had a genius for practical inventions immediately applicable. Tesla, whose inventions were far ahead of the time, aroused antagonisms which delayed the fruition of his ideas for years.

However, great physicists like Kelvin and Crookes spoke of his inventions as marvelous. "Tesla," said Professor A. E. Kennelly of Harvard University when the Edison medal was presented to the inventor, "set wheels going round all over the world. . . . What he showed was a revelation to science and art unto ail time."

"Were we," remarks B. A. Behrend, distinguished author and engineer, "to seize and to eliminate the results of Mr. Tesla's work, the wheels of industry would cease to turn, our electric cars and trains would stop, our towns would be dark, our mills would be dead and idle."


'''Forecasting is perilous. No man can look very far into the future. Progress and invention evolve in directions other than those anticipated. Such has been my experience, although I may flatter myself that many of the developments which I forecast have been verified by events in the first third of the twentieth century.


It seems that I have always been ahead of my time. I had to wait nineteen years before Niagara was harnessed by my system, fifteen years before the basic inventions for wireless which I gave to the world in 1893 were applied universally. I announced the cosmic ray and my theory of radio activity in 1896. One of my most important discoveries —terrestrial resonance— which is the foundation of wireless power transmission and which I announced in 1899, is not understood even today. Nearly two years after I had flashed an electric current around the globe, Edison, Steinmetz, Marconi, and others declared that it would not be possible to transmit even signals by wireless across the Atlantic. Having anticipated so many important developments, it is not without assurance that I attempt to predict what life is likely to be in the twenty-first century.


Life is and will ever remain an equation incapable of solution, but it contains certain known factors. We may definitely say that it is a movement even if we do not fully understand its nature. Movement implies a body which is being moved and a force which propels it against resistance. Man, in the large, is a mass urged on by a force. Hence the general laws governing movement in the realm of mechanics are applicable to humanity.

There are three ways by which the energy which determines human progress can be increased: First, we may increase the mass. This, in the case of humanity, would mean the improvement of living conditions, health, eugenics, etc. Second, we may reduce the frictional forces which impede progress, such as ignorance, insanity, and religious fanaticism. Third, we may multiply the energy of the human mass by enchaining the forces of the universe, like those of the sun, the ocean, the winds and tides.

The first method increases food and well-being. The second tends to bring peace. The third enhances our ability to work and to achieve. There can be no progress that is not constantly directed toward increasing well-being, peace, and achievement. Here the mechanistic conception of life is one with the teachings of Buddha and the Sermon on the Mount.


While I am not a believer in the orthodox sense, I commend religion, first, because every individual should have some ideal — religious, artistic, scientific, or humanitarian — to give significance to his life. Second, because all the great religions contain wise prescriptions relating to the conduct of life, which hold good now as they did when they were promulgated.
🐇
There is no conflict between the ideal of religion and the ideal of science, but science is opposed to theological dogmas because science is founded on fact. To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end. The human being is no exception to the natural order. Man, like the universe, is a machine. Nothing enters our minds or determines our actions which is not directly or indirectly a response to stimuli beating upon our sense organs from without. Owing to the similarity of our construction and the sameness of our environment, we respond in like manner to similar stimuli, and from the concordance of our reactions, understanding is barn. In the course of ages, mechanisms of infinite complexity are developed, but what we call '''soul''' or '''spirit,''' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the '''soul''' or the '''spirit''' ceases likewise.


I expressed these ideas long before the behaviorists, led by Pavlov in Russia and by Watson in the United States, proclaimed their new psychology. This apparently mechanistic conception is not antagonistic to an ethical conception of life. The acceptance by mankind at large of these tenets will not destroy religious ideals. Today Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance. I believe that the essence of both will be the religion of the human race in the twenty-first century.


🐇 The year 2100 will see xxx universally established. In past ages, the xxx governing the xxx of the xxx roughly xxx out the less xxx xxx. Then xxx's new sense of xxx began to interfere with the xxx workings of xxx. As a result, xxx continue to keep xxx and to xxx the xxx.

Hygiene, physical culture will be recognized branches of education and government. The Secretary of Hygiene or Physical Culture will be far more important in the cabinet of the President of the United States who holds office in the year 2035 than the Secretary of War. The pollution of our beaches such as exists today around New York City will seem as unthinkable to our children and grandchildren as life without plumbing seems to us. Our water supply will be far more carefully supervised, and only a lunatic will drink unsterilized water.


More people die or grow sick from polluted water than from coffee, tea, tobacco, and other stimulants. I myself eschew all stimulants. I also practically abstain from meat. I am convinced that within a century coffee, tea, and tobacco will be no longer in vogue. Alcohol, however, will still be used. It is not a stimulant but a veritable elixir of life. The abolition of stimulants will not come about forcibly. It will simply be no longer fashionable to poison the system with harmful ingredients. Bernarr Macfadden has shown how it is possible to provide palatable food based upon natural products such as milk, honey, and wheat. I believe that the food which is served today in his penny restaurants will be the basis of epicurean meals in the smartest banquet halls of the twenty-first century.

There will be enough wheat and wheat products to feed the entire world, including the teeming millions of China and India, now chronically on the verge of starvation. The earth is bountiful, and where her bounty fails, nitrogen drawn from the air will refertilize her womb. I developed a process for this purpose in 1900. It was perfected fourteen years later under the stress of war by German chemists.

Long before the next century dawns, systematic reforestation and the scientific management of natural resources will have made an end of all devastating droughts, forest fires, and floods. The universal utilization of water power and its long-distance transmission will supply every household with cheap power and will dispense with the necessity of burning fuel. The struggle for existence being lessened, there should be development along ideal rather than material lines.


🐇 Today the most civilized countries of the world spend a maximum of their income on war and a minimum on education. The twenty-first century will reverse this order. It will be more glorious to fight against ignorance than to die on the field of battle. The discovery of a new scientific truth will be more important than the squabbles of diplomats. Even the newspapers of our own day are beginning to treat scientific discoveries and the creation of fresh philosophical concepts as news. The newspapers of the twenty-first century will give a mere '''stick''' in the back pages to accounts of crime or political controversies, but will headline on the front pages the proclamation of a new scientific hypothesis.'''

'''It will be possible to destroy anything approaching within 200 miles. My invention will provide a wall of power,''' declares Tesla.

🐇 '''Progress along such lines will be impossible while nations persist in the savage practice of killing each other off. I inherited from my father, an erudite man who labored hard for peace, an ineradicable hatred of war. Like other inventors, I believed at one time that war could he stopped by making it more destructive. But I found that I was mistaken. I underestimated man's combative instinct, which it will take more than a century to breed out. We cannot abolish war by outlawing it. We cannot end it by disarming the strong. War can be stopped, not by making the strong weak but by making every nation, weak or strong, able to defend itself.

Hitherto all devices that could be used for defense could also be utilized to serve for aggression. This nullified the value of the improvement for purposes of peace. But I was fortunate enough to evolve a new idea and to perfect means which can be used chiefly for defense. If it is adopted, it will revolutionize the relations between nations. It will make any country, large or small, impregnable against armies, airplanes, and other means for attack. My invention requires a large plant, but once it is established it will be possible to destroy anything, men or machines, approaching within a radius of 200 miles. It will, so to speak, provide a wall of power offering an insuperable obstacle against any effective aggression.

If no country can be attacked successfully, there can be no purpose in war. My discovery ends the menace of airplanes or submarines, but it insures the supremacy of the battleship, because battleships may be provided with some of the required equipment. There might still be war at sea, but no warship could successfully attack the shore line, as the coast equipment will be superior to the armament of any battleship.


🐇 I want to state explicitly that this invention of mine does not contemplate the use of any so-called '''death rays.''' Rays are not applicable because they cannot be produced in requisite quantities and diminish rapidly in intensity with distance. All the energy of New York City (approximately two million horsepower) transformed into rays and projected twenty miles, could not kill a human being, because, according to a well known law of physics, it would disperse to such an extent as to be ineffectual.


My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of microscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great distance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of any kind. Many thousands of horsepower can thus be transmitted by a stream thinner than a hair, so that nothing can resist. This wonderful feature will make it possible, among other things, to achieve undreamed-of results in television, for there will be almost no limit to the intensity of illumination, the size of the picture, or distance of projection.

I do not say that there may not be several destructive wars before the world accepts my gift. I may not live to see its acceptance. But I am convinced that a century from now every nation will render itself immune from attack by my device or by a device based upon a similar principle.


At present we suffer from the derangement of our civilization because we have not yet completely adjusted ourselves to the machine age. The solution of our problems does not lie in destroying but in mastering the machine.


Innumerable activities still performed by human hands today will be performed by automatons. At this very moment scientists working in the laboratories of American universities are attempting to create what has been described as a '''thinking machine.''' I anticipated this development.


I actually constructed '''robots.''' Today the robot is an accepted fact, but the principle has not been pushed far enough. In the twenty-first century the robot will take the place which slave labor occupied in ancient civilization. There is no reason at all why most of this should not come to pass in less than a century, treeing mankind to pursue its higher aspirations.


🐇 And unless mankind's attention is too violently diverted by external wars and internal revolutions, there is no reason why the electric millennium should not begin in a few decades.'''

A red-headed boy in a Western Union uniform walked along the promenade in front of the Public Library on Fifth Avenue at Forty-second Street yesterday afternoon carrying a good-sized paper bag about which a flock of pigeons fluttered. He was doing a mission for Nikola Tesla, the famous inventor.

Mr. Tesla, at his apartment in the Hotel New Yorker, was reluctant to talk about the pigeons. Asked if it was he who had paid to have the boy feed them twice a day since last Fall, he replied:

‘‘‘Yes, I take care of them all the time.’’’

He has been Interested in pigeons for seventy-five years, since he was a small boy in his native village in Austrian Croatia. He will celebrate his eighty-first birthday on July 10.

The messenger, John Lucan, has become well known to the pigeons, and they fly to meet him as he walks to the feeding place in front of the south fountain, about 10 A. M. and 3:30 P. M. every day. He looks out for any that fall ill, and sees to it that they have their share of the five pounds of corn he distributes at a feeding. Mr. Tesla used to do this himself, but lately he has found it more convenient to send the boy.

During the Winter, and until the water in the fountains is turned on, Johnny has kept a small bath for the pigeons. Sometimes he has had to break ice off it, but it has always been there, in the south fountain, where the birds came to expect it. Johnny also feeds pigeons at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and in Bryant Park, back of the library.

Mr. Tesla's commission is only one of many novel sorts carried out by the boys of the telegraph companies. For example, some of the boys have developed a technique for rice-throwing at weddings. When a couple having only few friends in the city gets married, messengers with the proper experience may be hired to throw the rice at the right velocity to lend a sentimental touch while avoiding injury to the participants.

For several months a boy called every morning to chat with an elderly woman who felt that she needed some one to stimulate her interest in current events. He managed to find enough topics of conversation to keep the assignment going for a considerable time.

Other boys have taken children to theaters, demonstrated new articles to shopkeepers, climbed trees to rescue pet cats or birds, and minded offices while their proprietors went to lunch.

*** PREPARED STATEMENT BY NIKOLA TESLA ***
(Prior to interviews with the press on his 81st birthday observance.)
July 10, 1937 

'''At the close of 1889,
 having worked one year in the shops of George Westinghouse, Pittsburgh, I experienced so great a longing for resuming my interrupted investigations that, notwithstanding a very tempting proposition by him, I left for New York to take up my laboratory work, But owing to pressing demands by several foreign scientific societies I made a trip to Europe where I lectured before the Institution of Electrical Engineers and Royal Institution of London and the Societe de Physique in Paris. After this and a brief visit to my home in Yugoslavia I returned to this country in 1892 eager to devote myself to the subject of predilection on my thoughts: the study of the universe.


During the succeeding two years of intense concentration
I was fortunate enough to make two far-reaching discoveries. The first was a dynamic theory of gravity, which I have worked out in all details and hope to give to the world very soon. It explains the causes of this force and the motions of heavenly bodies under its influence so satisfactorily that it will put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space. According to the relativists, space has a tendency to curvature owing to an inherent property or presence of celestial bodies. Granting a semblance of reality to this fantastic idea, it is still self-contradictory. Every action is accompanied by an equivalent reaction and the effects of the latter are directly opposite to those of the former. Supposing that the bodies act upon the surrounding space causing curvature of the same, it appears to my simple mind that the curved spaces must react on the bodies and, producing the opposite effects, straighten out the curves. Since action and reaction are coexistent, it follows that the supposed curvature of space is entirely impossible. But even if it existed it would not explain the motions of the bodies as observed. Only the existence of a field of force can account for them and its assumption dispenses with space curvature. All literature on this subject is futile and destined to oblivion. So are also all attempts to explain the workings of the universe without recognizing the existence of the ether and the indispensable function it plays in the phenomena.


My second discovery was a physical truth of the greatest importance.
🐇 As I have searched the scientific records in  more than half dozen languages for a long time without finding the least anticipation, I consider myself the original discoverer of this truth, which can be expressed by the statement: There is no energy in matter other than that received from the environment. On my 79th birthday I made a brief reference to it, but its meaning and significance have become clearer to me since then. I applies rigorously to molecules and atoms as well as the largest heav-enly bodies, and to all matter in the universe in any phase of its existence from it: very formation to its ultimate disintegration.


Being perfectly satisfied that all energy in matter is drawn from the environment,
it was quite natural that when radioactivity was discovered in 1896, I immediately started a search for the external agent which caused it. The existence of radioactivity was positive proof of the existence of external rays. I had previously investigated various terrestrial disturbances affecting wireless circuits but none of them or any others emanating from the earth could produce a steady sustained action and I was driven to the conclusion that the activating rays were of cosmic origin. This fact I announced in my papers on Roentgen rays and Radiations contributed to the Electrical Review of New York, in 1897. However, as radioactivity was observed equally well in other widely separated parts of the world, it was obvious that the rays must be impinging on the earth from all directions. Now, of all bodies in the Cosmos, our sun was most likely to furnish a clue as to their origin and character. Before the electron theory was advanced, I had established that radioactive rays consisted of particles of primary matter not further decomposable, and the first question to answer was whether the sun is charged to a sufficiently high potential to produce the effects noted. This called for a prolonged investigation which culminated in my finding that the sun's potential was 216 billions of volts and that all such large and hot heavenly bodies emit cosmic rays. Through further solar research and observation of Novae this has been proved conclusively, and to deny it would be like denying the light and heat of the sun. Nevertheless, there are still some doubters who prefer to shroud the cosmic rays in deep mystery. I am sure that this is not true for there is no place where such a process occurs in this or any other universe beyond our ken.


A few words will be sufficient in support of this contention.
The kinetic and potential energy of a body is the result of motion and determined by the product of its mass and the square of velocity. Let the mass be reduced, the energy is diminished in the same proportion. If it be reduced to zero the energy is likewise zero for any finite velocity. In other words, it is absolutely impossible to convert mass into energy. It would be different if there were forces in nature capable of imparting to a mass infinite velocity. Then the product of zero mass with the square of infinite velocity would represent infinite energy. But we know that there are no such forces and the idea that mass is convertible into energy is rank nonsense.


While the origin and character of the rays observed near the earth's surface are sufficiently well ascertained, the so-called cosmic rays observed at great altitudes presented a riddle for more than 26 years, chiefly because it was found that they increased with altitude at a rapid rate. My investigations have brought out the astonishing fact that the effects at high altitudes are of an entirely different nature, having no relation whatever to cosmic rays. These are particles of matter projected from celestial bodies at very high temperature and charged to enormous electrical potentials. The effects at great elevations, on the other hand, are due to waves of extremely small lengths produced by the sun in a certain region in the atmosphere. This is the discovery which I wish to make known. The process involved in the generation of the waves is the following: The sun projects charged particles constituting an electric current which passes through a conducting stratum of the atmosphere approximately 10 kilometers thick enveloping the earth. This is a transmission of energy exactly as I illustrated in my experimental lectures in which one end of a wire is connected to an electric generator of high potential, its other end being free. In this case the generator is represented by the sun and the wire by the conducting air. The passage of the solar current involves the transference of electric charges from particle to particle with the speed of light, thus resulting in the production of extremely short and penetrating waves. As the air stratum mentioned is the source of the waves it follows that the so-called cosmic rays observed at great altitudes must increase as this stratum is approached.

My researches and calculations have brought to light the following facts in this connection:


(1) the intensity of the so-called cosmic rays must be greatest in the 🐇zenithal portion of atmosphere;


(2) the intensity should increase more and more rapidly up to an elevation of about 20 kilometers where the conducting air stratum begins;

(3) from there on the intensity should fall, first slowly and then more rapidly, to an insignificant value at an altitude of about 30 kilometers;


(4) the display of high potential must occur on the free end of the terrestrial wire, that is to say, on the side turned away from the sun. The current from the latter is supplied at a pressure of about 216 billion volts and there is a difference of 2 billion volts between the illuminated and the dark side of the globe. The energy of this current is so great that it readily accounts for the aurora and other phenomena observed in the atmosphere and at the earth's surface.


For the time being I must content myself with the announcement of the salient facts, but in due course I expect to be able to give more or less accurate technical data relating to all particulars of this discovery.

To go to another subject, I have devoted much of my time during the year to the perfecting of a new small and compact apparatus by which energy in considerable amounts can now be flashed through interstellar space to any distance without the slightest dispersion, I had in mind to confer with my friend George E. Hale, the great astronomer and solar expert, regarding the possible use of this invention in connection with his own researches. In the meantime, however, I am expecting to put before the Institute of France an accurate description of the devices with data and calculations and claim the Pierre Guzman Prize of 100,000 francs for means of communication with other worlds, feeling perfectly sure that it will be awarded to me. The money, of course, is a trifling consideration, but for the great historical honor of being the first to achieve this miracle I would be almost willing to give my life.

My most important invention from a practical point of view is a new form of tube with apparatus for its operation. In 1896 I brought out a high potential targetless tube which I operated successfully with potentials up to 4 million volts from '96 to '98. This device was adopted by many imitators and with slight modifications it is employed even now in all research laboratories and scientific institutions here and in other countries, and virtually all atomic investigations are carried on with it. At a later period I managed to produce very much higher potentials up to 18 million volts, and then I encountered unsurmountable difficulties which convinced me that it was necessary to invent an entirely different form of tube in order to carry out successfully certain ideas I had conceived. This task I found far more difficult than I had expected, not so much in the construction as in the operation of the tube. For many years I was baffled in my efforts, although I made a steady slow progress. Finally though, I was rewarded with complete success and I produced a tube which it will be hard to improve further. It is of ideal simplicity, not subject to wear and can be operated at any potential, however high, that can be produced. It will carry heavy currents, transform any amount of energy within practical limits, and it permits easy control and regulation of the same. I expect that this invention, when it becomes known, will be universally adopted in preference to other forms of tubes, and that it will be the means of obtaining results undreamed of before. Among others, it will enable the production of cheap radium substitutes in any desired quantity and will be, in general, immensely more effective in the smashing of atoms and the transmutation of matter. I am hopeful that it will be possible by its use to carry out a process in which there should be no misses whatever, but only hits. However, this tube will not open up a way to utilize atomic or subatomic energy for power purposes. According to the physical truth I have discovered there is no available energy in atomic structure, and even if there were any, the input will always greatly exceed the output, precluding profitable, practical use of the liberated energy.

Some papers have reported that I had promised to give a full description of my tube and its accessories on the present occasion. This has caused me a considerable annoyance-as, owing to some obligations I have undertaken regarding the application of the tube for important purposes, I am unable to make a complete disclosure now. But as soon as I am relieved of these obligations a technical description of the device and of all the apparatus will be given to scientific institutions.


There is one more discovery which I want to announce at this time, consisting of a new method and apparatus for the obtainment of vacua exceeding many times the highest heretofore realized. I think that as much as one-billionth of a micron can be attained. What may be accomplished by means of such vacua is a matter of conjecture, but it is obvious that they will make possible the production of much more intense effects in electron tubes. My ideas regarding the electron are at variance with those generally entertained. I hold that it is a relatively large body carrying a surface charge and not an elementary unit. When such an electron leaves an electrode of extremely high potential and in very high vacuum, it carries an electrostatic charge many times greater than the normal. This may astonish some of those who think that the particle has the same charge in the tube and outside of it in the air. A beautiful and instructive experiment has been contrived by me showing that such is not the case, for as soon as the particle gets out into the atmosphere it becomes a blazing star owing to the escape of the excess charge. The great quantity of electricity stored on the particle is responsible for the difficulties encountered in the operation of certain tubes and the rapid deterioration of the same.

Inventor, 81, Talks of Key to Interstellar Transmission and Tube to Produce Radium Copiously and Cheaply — Decorated by Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia

Reports of discoveries by which it will be possible to communicate with the planets and to produce radium in unlimited quantity for $1 a pound were announced by Dr. Nikola Tesla yesterday at a luncheon on his eighty-first birthday at which he wee[sic?] honored with high orders from the Yugoslav and Czechoslovak Governments.


Dr. Tesla, whose discoveries in electrical science have won for him recognition as the father of modern methods of generating and distributing electrical energy, asserted his ‘‘‘absolute’’’ belief that he would win the Pierre Guzman prize of the Institute of France for his discovery relating to the interstellar transmission of energy.


Following his annual custom, Dr. Tesla played host to a group of newspaper men at his birthday luncheon at the Hotel New Yorker and issued the announcement of his discoveries of the last year. No apparatus or sketches were shown, but Dr. Tesla said in announcing perfection of the principle of a new tube, which he said would make it possible to smash the atom and produce cheap radium, that he would be able to give a demonstration in ‘‘‘only a little time.’’’


Guests at Dr. Tesla's luncheon included Constantin Fotitch, Minister from Yugoslavia Vladimir Hurban, Minister from Czechoslovakia; R. Petrovich, first secretary of the Yugoslav delevation; B. P. Stoyanovitch, Yugoslav Consul General in New York; Dr. J. Nemeck, Counselor of the Czechoslav Legation, and J. Hajny, Acting Consul General in New York for Czechoslovakia.

Presenting to Dr. Tesla the Grand Cordon of the White Eagle, highest order of Yugoslavia, Mr. Fotitch announced it was the first time the order had been granted to an American for civil accomplishments. The honor was bestowed by order of Ring Peter through the Regent, Prince Paul.

    Dr. Tesla Predicts Linking Planets
Dr. Tesla's career has been an inspiration to the youth of his native country, the Minister said. Evidently referring to Dr. Tesla's report several years ago of inventing a ‘‘‘death beam’’’ for use as a defense weapon, the Minister said:


“All your efforts are directed to find a way, by means of some new magic invention of yours, by which you will check and render futile as much as possible all those inventions which men have invented to destroy mutually one another. You feel, as we all feel in your old country, that the world has seen enough of horror and that after so many examples of heroism displayed in the Great War, humanity has found a better way only in peace.”


Mr. Hurban, presenting the Grand Gordon of the White Lion, which has been granted to such other distinguished Americans as Secretary Kellogg, Elihu Root and Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, said “our Czechoslovak nation's brotherly feeling toward you as a son of Yugoslavia made it a duty, not a privilege, to give you this decoration in the name of the President of our nation. Dr. Edward Benes.” He also presented a diploma certifying Dr. Tesla's honorary degree as a doctor of the University of Prague.

    Outlines His Discoveries
Dr. Tesla, in responding, said he considered Czechoslovakia ‘‘‘one of the most enlightened countries in the world.’’’


In a ten-page typewritten statement outlining his discoveries, Dr. Tesla gave a resume of his work in the fields of gravity and cosmic rays. Asserting that ‘‘‘the so-called cosmic rays observed at great altitudes presented a riddle for more than twenty-six years chiefly because it was found that they increased with altitude at a rapid rate.’’’ Dr. Tesla said he had discovered ‘‘‘the astonishing fact that the effects at high altitudes are of an entirely different nature, having no relation whatever to cosmic rays.’’’


He gave a detailed technical description of his conclusions from research and calculations concerning the cosmic ray, and continued:

‘‘‘For the time being, I must content myself with the announcement of the salient facts, but in due course I expect to be able to give more or less accurate technical data relating to all particulars of this discovery.’’’


    Digressing from his prepared statement, he said:

‘‘‘I am proud of these discoveries, because many have denied that I am the original discoverer of the cosmic ray. I was fifteen years ahead of other fellows who were asleep. Now no one can take away from me the credit of being the first discoverer of the cosmic ray on earth.’’’


Dr. Tesla's audience stirred as he took up the next phase of his discoveries.

‘‘‘I have devoted much of my time during the year past,’’’ he said, ‘‘‘to the perfecting of a new small and compact apparatus by which energy in considerable amounts can now be flashed through interstellar space to any distance without the slightest dispersion.’’’


    To Claim French Award
Explaining that he did not refer to his ‘‘‘universal peace discovery,’’’ Dr. Tesla continued:

‘‘‘I am expecting to put before the Institute of France an accurate description of the devices with data and calculations and claim the Pierre Guzman prize of 100,000 francs for means of communication with other worlds, feeling perfectly sure that it will be awarded to me. The money, of course, is a trifling consideration, but for the great historical honor of being the first to achieve this miracle I would be almost willing to give my life.[sic?]

‘‘‘I am just as sure that prize will be awarded to me as if I already had it in my pocket. They have got to do it. It means it will be possible to convey several thousand units of horsepower to other planets, regardless of the distance. This discovery of mine will be remembered when everything else I have done, is covered with 🐇dust.’’’

Reporters questioned Dr. Tesla closely on his report of an interplanetary communication system. He said he had been working in several laboratories, but refused to disclose where they were. Asked if he had a working model of the apparatus, he said, ‘‘‘it employs more than three dozen of my inventions; it is a complex apparatus, an agglomeration of parts.’’’


‘‘‘It is absolutely developed,’’’ he declared. ‘‘‘I wouldn't be any surer that I can transmit energy 100 miles that I am of the fact that I can transmit energy 1,000,000 miles 🐇up.’’’


A 🐇 different kind of energy than is commonly employed must be used, however, he said, explaining further that ‘‘‘you must realize it travels through a channel of less than one-half of one-millionth of a centimeter.’’’


‘‘‘I could undertake a contract to manufacture the apparatus,’’’ he asserted.

Dr. Tesla declared that ‘‘‘life on other planets is an infinite probability, a certitude.’’’ A difficulty in using his apparatus, he said, would lie in hitting other moving planets with ‘‘‘the needle-point of tremendous energy,’’’ but astronomers could help solve this problem.

The point of energy could be aimed at the moon and ‘‘‘we very easily could see the effects, see the splash and the volatilization of matter.’’’ He also pictured the possibility of advanced thinkers living on other planets and also experimenting in this field, but mistaking the Tesla energy rays 🐇 for some form of cosmic rays.


    Dr. Tesla provoked a new stir with his next announcement.
‘‘‘My most important invention from a practical point of view,’’’ he said, ‘‘‘is a new form of tube with apparatus for its operation.’’’

    Reports Tube of New Type
Recalling experiments with other tubes, he said he had been ‘‘‘rewarded with complete success’’’ and had ‘‘‘produced a tube which it will be hard to improve further.’’’


‘‘‘It is of ideal simplicity,’’’ he said, ‘‘‘not subject to wear and can be operated at any potential, however high — even 100,000,000 volts — that can be produced. It will carry heavy currents, transform any amount of energy within practical limits and it permits easy control and regulation of the same.[sic?]

‘‘‘I expect that this invention, when it becomes known, will be universally adopted in preference to other form of tubes and that it will be the means of obtaining results undreamed of before.[sic?]


‘‘‘Among others, it will enable the production of cheap radium substitutes in any desired quantity and will be, in general, immediately more effective in the smashing of atoms and the transmutation of matter. However, this tube will not open up a way to utilize atomic or subatomic energy for power purposes.’’’

‘‘‘It will cheapen radium so,’’’ Dr. Tesla added, ‘‘‘that it will be just a cheap — well, it will get down to $1 a pound, in any quantity.’’’


Expressing ‘‘‘annoyance’’’ that some newspapers had indicated he would ‘‘‘give a full description’’’ of his atom-smashing tube at yesterday's luncheon, Dr. Tesla said he was bound by financial obligations ‘‘‘involving vast sums of money’’’ against releasing this information.

‘‘‘But it is not an experiment,’’’ he declared. ‘‘‘I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world.’’’


A final discovery announced by Dr. Tesla involved a new method and apparatus for further perfection of vacuum tubes.

‘‘‘What may be accomplished by means of such vacua is a matter of conjecture, but it is obvious that they will make possible the production of much more intense effects in electron tubes.’’’ he said.


Before and during the luncheon, Dr. Tesla entertained his guests with colorful personal reminiscences and observations including his opinions on dieting and immortality.

     New York Herald Tribune
July 27th, 1937 Page number(s): 147

I have been a reader of your excellent paper for more than fifty years and feel much obliged to you for the pleasure and enlightenment derived from its perusal. Many of your admirable editorials are on my files. Under these circumstances it is unfortunate that your issue of Sunday, July 11, contained a report very injurious to me.

The particularly damaging statement is: "The decorations made very little impression on Dr. Tesla. ‘’’They mean nothing — take them away,’’’ said Dr. Tesla."

I should say that the expression on my face in the photograph accompanying the report, would be sufficient to disprove the above assertion. When it became necessary to clear the table I was very anxious that the precious objects be placed in safe hands and requested my old friend, George Scherff, auditor of the Union Sulphur Company, who was one of the honored guests, to take care of them. Moreover, as soon as I was free, I cabled His Royal Highness Prince Regent Paul of Yugoslavia and to His Excellency Dr. Eduard Benes, President of Czechoslovakia, expressing my profound gratitude for the rare distinctions conferred upon me and my great pride of possessing them. It was desirable to show in the photograph the Yugoslav Minister handing me the order of the White Eagle but His Excellency Konstantin Fotitch, besides being a master in diplomacy, is a man of commanding stature in other respects, and he did not insist. However, a more charming dignitary than Dr. Vladimir Hurban, Minister of Czechoslovakia, could not be imagined.

by John J. O'Neill
New York Herald Tribune
August 22nd, 1937

The failure of forecasters to predict the results of scientific discoveries, particularly with respect to their social and economic significance, was emphasized in the recent report on technical trends and their social implications submitted to President Roosevelt by the National Resources Committee. One of the outstanding oversights was radio broadcasting. None of the previewers of coming events saw this development of radio communication.

With this as justification, some attention might be given to the recent announcement by Nikola Tesla, the inventor, whose mind has given us a great many of the major developments forming the foundation of our electrical age. Dr. Tesla seldom writes for publication, but back in 1900 he wrote an article for the June issue of “The Century Magazine,” which contained predictions that seemed at that time very fantastic. Those who may read it now will be amazed to find how many of the author’s prophecies have proved true.

    Advance Seen Fantastic
Some of the advances described by him during the last few years as the result of his investigations may appear equally fantastic today, but one has only to know of Dr. Tesla’s past performances in order to have faith that given time and money they could be made realities. Forty years ago he was playing with electrical discharges of many millions of volts, while today scientists have difficulty in developing a fraction of those potentials for their atom-smashing and x-ray experiments. Long before the days of Marconi, Tesla girdled the earth with giant electrical waves from his high voltage generators, and on the basis of this work predicted both the “transmission of intelligence without wires” and the “wireless transmission of power.” He controlled a vessel at a distance by wireless power forty years before the advent of our present-day manless aerial torpedoes.

🐇 ‘‘‘They laughed at me in 1897 when I told them about the cosmic ray,” he said in a recent interview. “Fifty years ago they attempted to discredit my discovery of the rotating magnetic field and my system of power transmission by alternating currents. They called me crazy when I predicted the radio and when I sent the first impulse around the world they said it couldn’t be done.’’’

So with Tesla’s latest discoveries and inventions. There may be many who are skeptical, but the world is moving forward rapidly and man is constantly doing things a short time before considered impossible. Forty years ago Tesla was predicting world-wide radio communications. Today this accomplishment is history. Now he is predicting interplanetary communication.

    Jovian Bolts His Aim
Dr. Tesla gave assurance that he did not mean just sending weak signals, but veritable Jovian bolts carrying energy of several thousand horsepower which would be able to produce tremendous effects at the receiving end, even though it be infinitely remote. A test of this invention could be made most advantageously on our nearest heavenly neighbor, the moon. Sufficient energy, he said, could be transmitted to render a small spot on its surface incandescent so that it could be easily observed from the earth.

This is a further extension of the announcement previously made by Dr. Tesla that he would be able to transmit over a beam of not more than one hundred thousandths of a square centimeter in cross section adequate amounts of energy for operating all kinds of machinery at distances limited only by the earth’s curvature. Such a beam, he pointed out, could be used not only for constructive but also destructive purposes as annihilating military forces or aerial fleets.

While Dr. Tesla is keeping a deep secret of the mechanism by which he plans to provide unlimited energy, it is apparent he is bent on using natural forces that operate on a vast scale. To be specific, it seems that the energy is coming to us in the form of cosmic rays, but Tesla’s theory of these rays is different from those of Dr. Robert A. Millikan or Dr. Karl T. Compton.

He formulated his theory in 1897 when he sought to explain the production of the phenomena of radio activity by some other means than atomic explosions. 🐇 He held that all energy an atom exhibits is received from its environment and does not come from itself. Accordingly, he explained radio activity as a result of the shattering of atoms by sub-atomic cosmic particles. Whence did they come? was the question.

‘‘‘Now, of all bodies in the cosmos,’’’ states Dr. Tesla, ‘‘‘our sun was the most likely to furnish a clue as to their origin and character. Before the electron theory was advanced, I had established that radio-active rays consisted of particles of primary matter not further decomposable, and the first thing to find out was whether the sun is charged to a sufficiently high potential to produce the effects noted. This called for a prolonged investigation which culminated in my discovery that the sun’s potential was 216,000,000,000 volts and that all such large and hot bodies emit cosmic rays.’’’

    Puzzle of Mystery Rays
‘‘‘While the origin and character of the rays observed near the earth’s surface had thus been sufficiently well ascertained, the so-called cosmic rays observed at great altitudes presented a riddle for more than twenty-six years, chiefly because it was found they increased with the height at a rapid rate. My investigations brought out the astonishing fact that the effects at high altitude are of an entirely different nature, having no relation whatever to cosmic rays. These are particles from celestial bodies at very high temperatures and charged to enormous electrical potentials.’’’

🐇 It might be remarked parenthetically that Dr. Tesla does not accept the concept of the electron presented by physicists as an elementary unit and carrying a unit charge of electricity. He holds that the electron in a well-exhausted tube operated at high potential carries many multiples of this unit charge. The ignorance of this fact is responsible for many errors and fallacies in various scientific investigations.

‘‘‘The effects at great elevations,’’’ Dr. Tesla continued, ‘‘‘are due to waves of extremely small lengths produced by the sun in a certain region of the atmosphere. This is the discovery I wish to make known. The process involved in the generation of the waves is the following: The sun projects charged particles constituting an electric current which passes through a conducting stratum of the atmosphere approximately ten kilometers (six miles) thick enveloping the earth. This is a transmission of electrical energy exactly as I illustrated in my experimental lecture in which one end of a wire is connected to an electric generator of high potential, its other end being free. In this case the generator is represented by the sun and the wire by the conducting air.’’’

    Production of the Waves
‘‘‘The passage of solar current involves the transference of electric charges from particle to particle with the speed of light, resulting in the production of extremely short and penetrating waves. As the air stratum mentioned is the source of the waves it follows that the so-called cosmic rays observed at great altitude must increase as this stratum is approached.’’’

Another of the Tesla inventions is a radically new tube which is indestructible and can handle heavy currents up to any voltage that can be produced, even 100,000,000 volts. It will be useful, he promises, in the production of cheap radium substitutes and in the transformation of matter. Still another invention consists in means for the production of a practically perfect vacuum of the order of 1,000,000,000th of a micron.

While Dr. Tesla does not say so, it is assumed that these latter inventions are parts of the system which he would use in the transmission of energy to the moon or other planets. Such an application would be spectacular, but the inventions when described and made public would have applications of more immediate practical value 🐇 in industrial operations.

He was honored on his birthday by the bestowal of the highest distinctions within the power of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, which recognition touched him deeply all the more as Konstantin Fotitch and Vladimir Hurban, ministers of these countries, came from Washington especially for the occasion. Dr. Tesla is now eighty-one and works continuously at his investigations. He has not been halted even by a recent accident in which he was knocked down by a taxicab. It merely caused the customary bruises and upset the digestion a bit, he said.

*** INSTITUTE OF IMMIGRANT WELFARE SPEECH ***
by Nikola Tesla, read in absentia
Hotel Baltimore, New York City NY
May 11th, 1938

'''Mr. Chairman, Members of the Institute of Immigrant Welfare, Ladies and Gentlemen:

I can not find words to express adequately my keen regret for being unable to receive, in person, the high distinction which the Institute of Immigrant Welfare has conferred upon me. Although my recovery from injuries sustained in an automobile accident six months ago is almost complete, I do not feel equal to the task of appearing in public and meeting the obligations which this would impose upon me.

My coming to this country was a great adventure - every detail of which is still vivid in my memory.
Early in 1884, while employed by a French Company in Paris, I made important improvements in dynamos and motors and was engaged by the Edison interests in New York to design and construct similar machines for them.
It had been the height of my ambition and my most ardent wish to come in contact with Edison and see America.


🐇 Accordingly, I undertook the voyage and after losing my money and tickets and passing through a series of mishaps, including a mutiny in which I nearly lost my life, I landed on these blessed shores with four cents in my pocket.


My first intention was to look up a close American friend before going to the Edison establishment.

On my way uptown I came to a small machine shop in which the foreman was trying to repair an electric machine of European make.
He had just given up the task as hopeless and I undertook to put it in order without a thought of compensation.
It was not easy but I finally had it in perfect running condition.
I was astonished when he gave me twenty dollars and wished that I had come to America years before.


The next day I was thrilled to the marrow by meeting Edison who began my American education right then and there.
I wanted to have my shoes shined, something I considered below my dignity.
🐇 Edison said: "Tesla, you will shine the shoes yourself and like it."
He impressed me tremendously. I shined my shoes and liked it.


I began the work for which I was engaged immediately and after nine months of strenuous effort I fulfilled my contract rigorously.
The manager had promised me fifty thousand dollars but when I demanded payment, he merely laughed.


🐇 "You are still a Parisian," remarked Edison, "when you become a full-fledged American you will appreciate an American joke."


I felt deeply hurt as I had expected to use the money in the development of my alternating system and when some people proposed to form a company under my name, I accepted eagerly.
Here was the opportunity I had vainly sought for years but my new friends were adamant in their resolve not to have anything to do with the worthless alternating currents which Edison condemned as deadly.

They desired an arc light system and I had to comply with their request though the delay of my cherished plans was agonizing.
In one year of day and night application, I managed to perfect the system which was adopted for lighting the city and some factories in the neighborhood.

Then came the hardest blow I ever received. Through some local influences, I was forced out of the company losing not only all my interest but also my reputation as engineer and inventor.
After that I lived through a year of terrible heartaches and bitter tears, my suffering being intensified by material want. Very often I was compelled to work as a laborer and my high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery.

Finally, I had the good fortune of meeting two capable and honest men who listened to me and came to my assistance. They organized a company, provided a laboratory and gave me a modest but sure financial support.
I perfected my motors quickly having nothing else to do except to carry out plans I had formed years before.

Pty inventions proved a success and attracted the attention of George Westinghouse. He was, in my opinion; the only man on this globe who could take my alternating system under the circumstances then existing and win the battle against prejudice and money power.
He was a pioneer of imposing stature, one of the world's true noblemen of whom America may well be proud and to whom humanity owes an immense debt of gratitude.


I have to add that in all my troubles I did not neglect to declare my intention of becoming a citizen of this glorious country and in due course I secured my papers making me a proud and happy man.

July 10th, 1938


Wants to Finish Therapeutic Device Which He Calls Boon for Newspaper Offices


For the first time in a number of years, Dr. Nikola Tesla, scientist and inventor, who is 82 years old today, is postponing his annual birthday party for the press so he may complete a mechanical therapeutic device for public demonstration.

Dr. Tesla said yesterday he hopes to have his apparatus completed within two weeks, and then will give a demonstration to the press.

For the last forty years Dr. Tesla has been the storm center of scientific controversy. Recognized in the early part of his career as the father of modern methods of generating and distributing electrical energy, and pre-dating even Marconi in his experiments with wireless, Dr. Tesla has been decorated by many governments for his accomplishments. In recent years, however, it has been his custom to announce at his annual parties the perfection of inventions which some scientists have challenged as fantastic.

The therapeutic device, Dr. Tesla said yesterday, is an improvement of an invention he perfected many years ago before his famous laboratory burned, about 1895. He said it will cure many internal disorders. He used it to advantage on his friend, Mark Twain, Dr. Tesla said.


🐇 ‘‘‘One of these devices in every newspaper office and the proverbial ‘editorial grouch’ will be gone,’’’ the inventor predicted.


He also expects to announce this year the perfection of another invention — outside of the field of electricity — that ‘‘‘will benefit the $1,000,000,000-a-year poultry industry,’’’ Dr. Tesla said. It will improve the size, quality and quantity of eggs and chickens, he stated.


Dr. Tesla lives on the thirty-third floor of Hotel New Yorker, where, in one large room crowded with plans, boxes and technical references, he conducts his experiments and research.

📰 REFERENCE TO COMPASS IN 13TH CENTURY POEM 📰
by Nikola Tesla
Science News Letter
October 8th, 1938 Page number(s): 238

Among the oldest references to the mariner’s compass is a passage in a poem by a little known French writer, Guyot de Provins, who wrote early in the thirteenth century. I first came upon this reference many years ago, during a period of omnivorous reading while I was convalescing from a nearly fatal attack of cholera morbus.

Among the many books I received there was a large volume of citations, gems of literature of all nations in a dozen languages, which aroused my special interest. Most of the excerpts from famous works, in verse or prose, collected by the author, impressed me so strongly by their beauty of thought and expression that even now I can recite many of them without a miss.

It was in this volume that I found the reference to the compass mentioned in the introduction. It was credited to Guyot de Provins, a French poet of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and, if my memory serves me well, worded as follows:

“Quand la mer est obscure et brune
Qu’on ne voit ni etoile ni lune
Donc font l’aiguille allumer,
Puis n’ont garde de s’egarer
Contre l’etoile va la pointe.”

I translate freely:

‘‘‘When gloomy darkness hides the sea
And one no star and moon can see
They turn on the needle the light,
Then from the straying they have no fright
For the needle points to the star.’’’

🐇 As a rule, medieval records do not commend themselves for clarity; in fact, not a few are of very small value to the searcher. It is therefore remarkable that this ancient reference to the compass should be so strikingly clear and explicit.

After reading Guyot’s verses one is impelled by the wish to know something more about him. With this intention I tried to obtain information from the New York Public Library but his name was not mentioned in any of the catalogues. I then made a thorough examination of the General Index, which was equally unsuccessful, but found a brief notice in the Grande Encyclopedie Francaise.

This item being of unusual interest I have an English translation:

Guyot de Provins, French poet, towards 1200. Undoubtedly, after being a minstrel and going, perhaps to Jerusalem, he became a Benedictine in Clairvaux and later in Cluny. He composed between 1203 and 1208, in a style lively and original, but harsh and hard, a satirical work consisting of 2691 octosyllabic verses, which he entitled “Bible,” probably to indicate that he intended to say only what is true, and in which he passed in review almost the whole contemporary society. Especially noteworthy is his criticism of the Pope, expressed with great independence, and that of the high clergy and physicians, and a number of passages in which he argues that the compass was known in his time.

*** A STORY OF YOUTH TOLD BY AGE ***
  Dedicated to Miss Pola Fotitch
          BY ITS AUTHOR
          NIKOLA TESLA

'''My dear Miss Fotitch:

Fig.1 
Illustration of Nikola Tesla with Macak, his cat, outside his childhood home.

I am forwarding to you the "Calendar of Yugoslavia" of 1939 showing the house and community in which I had many joyful and sad experiences and odd adventures and in which also, by a coincidence bizarre, I was born. As you may see from the photograph on the sheet for June, the old-fashioned building is located at the foot of a wooded hill called Bogdanic. Adjoining it is a church and behind it a little further up a graveyard. Our nearest neighbors were two miles away and in the winter, when the snow was six or seven feet deep, our isolation was complete.

My mother was indefatigable and worked regularly from four o'clock in the morning till eleven in the evening. From four to breakfast time, 6 A.M., while others slumbered, I never closed my eyes but watched my mother with intense pleasure as she attended quickly — sometimes running — to her many self-imposed duties. She directed the servants to take care of all domestic animals, milked the cows, performed all sorts of labor unassisted, set the table, prepared breakfast for the whole household and only when it was ready to be served did the rest of the family get up. After breakfast everybody followed by mother's inspiring example. All did their work diligently, liked it and so achieved a measure of contentment. But I was the happiest of them, the fountain of my enjoyment being our magnificent Mačak - the finest of all cats in the world. I wish that I could give you an adequate idea of the depth of affection which existed between me and him. You would look vainly in the mythological and historical records for such a case. We simply lived one for the other. Wherever I went Mačak followed primarily owing to our mutual love and then again moved by the desire to protect me. When such a necessity presented itself he would rise to twice his normal height, buckle his back and with the tail as rigid as a metal bar and whiskers like steel wires he would give vent to his rage by explosive puffs Pfftt! Pfftt! It was a terrifying sight and whatever provoked him, human being or animal, beat a hasty retreat.

Fig. 2
Illustration of Nikola Tesla's mother working in the kitchen.

In the evening we went through our usual program. I would run from the house along the church and he would rush after me and grab me by the trousers. He tried hard to make me believe that he would bite, but the instant his needle sharp incisors penetrated the clothing the pressure ceased and their contact with my skin was as gentle and tender as that of a butterfly alighting on a petal. He liked best to roll on the grass with me. While we were doing this he bit and clawed and purred in rapturous pleasure. He fascinated me so completely that I too bit and clawed and purred. We just could not stop and rolled and rolled and rolled and rolled in a delirium[sic?] of delight. We indulged in this enchanting sport day by day except on rainy weather. In respect to water Mačak was very fastidious. He would jump six feet to avoid wetting his paws. On such occasions we went into the house and, selecting a nice cosy[sic?] place, abandoned ourselves for each other in affectionate embracement. Mačak was scrupulously clean, had no fleas or bugs whatever, shed no hair and showed none of the objectionable traits and habits of cats as I knew them later. He was touchingly delicate in signifying his wish to be let out at night and scratched the door gently for readmittance.

Now I must tell you of a strange and unforgettable experience which bore fruit in my later life. Our home is about eighteen hundred feet above sea level and in the winter we had dry weather as a rule, but sometimes it happened that a warm wind from the Adriatic would blow persistently for a long time, melting rapidly the snow, flooding the land and causing great loss of property and life. We would then witness the terrifying spectacle of a mighty seething river carrying wreckage and tearing down everything moveable in its way. Since I often visualize the events of my youth to find relief from great and dangerous mental strain and when I think of the scene the roar of the waters fills my ears and I see as vividly as then, their tumultuous flow and the mad dance of the wreckage. This leaves me, for a while, sad and depressed. But always agreeable are my recollections of winter with its dry cold and snow of immaculate white.

Fig. 3
Illustration of Nikola Tesla with his cat, Mačak.

It happened that on the day of my experience we had a cold drier than ever observed before. People walking in the snow left a luminous trail behind them and a snowball thrown against an obstacle gave a flare of light like a loaf of sugar hit with a knife. It was dusk of the evening and I felt impelled to stroke Mačak's back. Mačak's back was a sheet of light and my hand produced a shower of sparks loud enough to be heard all over the place. My father was a very learned man, he had an answer for every question. But this phenomenon was new even to him. Well, he finally remarked, this is nothing but electricity, the same thing you see on the trees in a storm. My mother seemed alarmed. Stop playing with the cat, she said, he might start a fire. I was thinking abstractedly. Is nature a gigantic cat? If so, who strokes its back? It can only be God, I concluded. You may know that Pascal was an extraordinarily precocious child who attracted attention before he reached the age of six years. But here I was, only three years old, and already philosophizing[sic?]!

I can not exaggerate the effect of this marvellous[sic?] sight on my childish imagination. Day after day I asked myself what is electricity and found no answer. Eighty years have gone by since and I still ask the same question, unable to answer it. Some pseudo scientist of whom there are only too many may tell you that he can, but do not believe him. If any of them knew what it is I would also know and the chances are better than any of them for my laboratory and practical experiences are more extensive and my life covers three generations of scientific research.

Fig. 4
Illustration of Nikola Tesla and his cat, Mačak, watching a lightning storm.

My childhood in Mačak's delightful company and undying friendship would have passed blissfully if I did not have a powerful enemy, relentless and irreconcilable. This was our gander, a monstrous ugly brute, with a neck of an ostrich, mouth of a crocodile and a pair of cunning eyes radiating intelligence and understanding like the human. I aroused his ire by throwing pebbles at him, a most foolish and reckless act which I bitterly regretted afterwards. I liked to feed our pigeons, chickens, and other fowl, take one or the other under my arm and hug and pet it. But the brute would not let me. The moment I entered the poultry yard he would attack me and as I fled grab me by the seat of my trousers and shake me viciously. When I finally managed to free myself and run away he would flap his huge wings in glee and raise an unholy chatter in which all the geese joined. When I grew up two aunts of mine used to tell me how I answered certain questions they asked. One was Aunt Veva who had two protruding teeth like the tusks of an elephant. She loved me passionately and buried them deep in my cheek in kissing me. I cried out from pain but she thought it was from pleasure and dug them in still deeper. Nevertheless I preferred her to the other aunt whose name has slipped from my memory and she used to glue her lips to mine and suck and suck until by frantic efforts I managed to free myself gasping for breath. These two aunts amused themselves by asking me all sorts of questions of which I remember a few. Are you afraid of Luka Bogic? No! Luka always carried a gun and threatened to shoot. He robbed other boys of pennies and gave them to me. Are you afraid of the cow? No !' That was one of our cows and very nice until one day I slid from a fence on her back for a ride when she made off with me bellowing and threw me. I was none the worse for the experience. Are you afraid of the bad wolf? No! No! This was the wolf I met in the woods near the church. He was looking at me fixedly and approaching slowly. I shouted as usual when a wolf is around and he trotted away slowly. My present visualization of this scene is astonishingly sharp and clear. After a number of such questions one of the aunts asked me; Are you afraid of the gander? Yes! Yes! I replied emphatically, I am afraid of the gander! I had good reason to be. One summer day my mother had given me a rather cold bath and put me out for a sun warming in Adam's attire. When she stepped in the house the gander espied me and charged. The brute knew where it would hurt most and seized me by the nape almost pulling out the remnant of my umbilical cord. My mother, who came in time to prevent further injury, said to me: "You must know that you can not make peace with a gander or a cock whom you have taunted. 🐇 They will fight you as long as they live." But now and then I would play in the poultry yard to my heart's content for on certain days our geese, led by the gander, rose high in the air and flew down to the meadow and brook where they sported like swans in the water and probably found some food. I would then feed and pet the pigeons, the poultry and our grand resplendent[sic?] cock who liked me. In the evening the gander brought back his flock who made a few turns above the house and then came down with a deafening noise. The sight of the flying geese was a joy and inspiration to see.'''

# CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE OF ALKALINE EARTH METALS RESULTING FROM NEUTRON IRRADIATION OF URANIUM #
by O. Hahn and F. Strassmann
Die Naturwissenschaften
January 1939 (27) Pages: 11-15
[Translation in American Journal of Physics, January 1964, Pages 9-15]

..."As chemists we really ought to revise the decay scheme given above and insert the symbols Ba, La, Ce, in place of Ra, Ac, Th. However as "nuclear chemists," working very close to the field of physics, we cannot bring ourselves yet to take such a drastic step which goes against all previous experience in nuclear physics. There could perhaps be a series of unusual coincidences which has given us false indications.

It is intended to carry out further tracer experiments with the new radioactive decay products. In particular a combined fractionation will be attempted, using the radium isotope resulting from fast neutron irradiation of thorium (investigated by Meitner, Strassmann, and Hahn) together with our alkaline earth metals resulting from uranium. At places where strong neutron sources are available, this project could actually be carried out much more easily."

# PRODUCTS OF THE FISSION OF THE URANIUM NUCLEUS #
by Lise Meitner & O. R. Frisch
Nature
March 18, 1939 (143) Pages: 471-472

"Over the Christmas holiday, Meitner had a visit from her nephew, Otto Frisch, a physicist who worked in Copenhagen at Niels Bohr's institute. Meitner shared Hahn's letter with Frisch. They knew that Hahn was a good chemist and had not made a mistake, but the results didn't make sense. They went for a walk in the snow to talk about the matter, Frisch on skis, Meitner keeping up on foot. They stopped at a tree stump to do some calculations. Meitner suggested they view the nucleus like a liquid drop, following a model that had been proposed earlier by the Russian physicist George Gamow and then further promoted by Bohr. Frisch, who was better at visualizing things, drew diagrams showing how after being hit with a neutron, the uranium nucleus might, like a water drop, become elongated, then start to pinch in the middle, and finally split into two drops.

After the split, the two drops would be driven apart by their mutual electric repulsion at high energy, about 200 MeV, Frisch and Meitner figured. Where would the energy come from? Meitner determined that the two daughter nuclei together would be less massive than the original uranium nucleus by about one-fifth the mass of a proton, which, when plugged into Einstein’s famous formula, E=mc2, works out to 200 MeV. Everything fit.

Frisch left Sweden after Christmas dinner. Having made the initial breakthrough, he and Meitner collaborated by long-distance telephone. Frisch talked briefly with Bohr, who then carried the news of the discovery of fission to America, where it met with immediate interest.

Meitner and Frisch sent their paper to Nature in January. Frisch named the new nuclear process "fission" after learning that the term "binary fission" was used by biologists to describe cell division. Hahn and Strassmann published their finding separately, and did not acknowledge Meitner’s role in the discovery."

🗞️ THE SOVIET SACRIFICE FOR SPAIN 🗞️
New York Herald, The
by Nikola Tesla
July 26, 1939

An Estimate That Republic Received Billion and a Half Dollars

'''To the New York Herald Tribune:

Your issue of July 9, 1939, contains an article relating to the seizure of Spanish gold by the Soviet government. Another one, dealing with the same subject, appeared in "The Saturday Evening Post" of April 15, 1939. Without entering into a discussion of the merits of these comments upon the question raised, I may remark that, for obvious reasons, any expression of opinion concerning this matter by Americans is likely to be very unfavorable to the Soviet government, and in the interest of common justice it should be weighed without prejudice. What I wish to bring to the attention of fair-minded readers is that the articles referred to do not give the slightest hint in regard to the chief fact to be ascertained, which had a profound bearing on the course decided upon by the Soviets -namely, the sacrifice their struggle on behalf of the oppressed party in Spain involved. They fought vigorously for a cause considered rightful by a large portion of the population, and the ownership of gold and other property was undecided until the termination of the conflict.

Everybody knows that modern warfare is desperately expensive, but few will realize how costly it must have been for the Soviet government, under the disadvantages, obstacles and handicaps confronting it. I was desirous of making an approximate estimate of the cost, and with this object in view I gathered all the available data. Considering carefully the actual outlays in money, the loss of men, of airplanes, guns and other implements of war, ships and munitions, and the supply of food, oil and all kinds of provisions transported from great distance, etc., I have satisfied myself that the Soviet government must have spent, at the very least $1,500,000,000. If this estimate is reasonably accurate, the Spanish gold appropriated amounted to about one-third of the cost. Any government would have acted so under similar circumstances. England, France, Germany and Italy are on record with deeds not at all commendable. What the Soviet government did was perfectly legitimate, in view of the preceding events.

The idea that the boxes brought from Spain were sufficient to cover Red Square is absurd. It would mean not five but something like one hundred times that amount of gold. The metal always is shipped in ounces and its value determined from the prevailing market quotations.

Through the attitude of England and France the Soviet government found itself isolated, and Stalin then made a proposal for non-interference. But Italy and Germany paid no attention to it and poured tens of thousands of men into Spain to Franco's assistance. Even then Russia was ready to carry on the war. She could swallow Italy in a gulp and not suffer dyspepsia, and if Hitler dared to attack her he would have been badly defeated and Germany would have become again an empire under the Hohenzollern dynasty, probably with the restoration of the status quo ante Hitler regime and recreated free Czechoslovakia. England and France being emphatically against Russian influence in Spain, Stalin had to withdraw, but in so doing he certainly did not "knife" the Spanish republic.'''

# THE EINSTEIN LETTER THAT STARTED IT ALL; A MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT 25 YEARS AGO LAUNCHED THE ATOM BOMB AND THE ATOMIC AGE. #
New York Times, The
Aug. 2, 1964

"ON Aug. 2, 1939, Albert Einstein scrawled his signature on a twopage letter that changed the course of history. The letter began:

F. D. Roosevelt,
President of the United States,
White House
Washington, D. C.

Sir:

Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. I believe therefore it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations.

In the course of the last four months it has been made probable through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium‐like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.

A third paragaph contained the prophetic words: “… it is conceivable —though much less certain—that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed.” Two more paragraphs outlined steps to be taken to accelerate uranium research and the letter ended with a warning that uranium sales had been stopped in Czechoslovakia and secret German research was under way. The letter concluded: “Yours very truly, A. Einstein.”

POFESSOR EINSTEIN had never expected he would write such a letter. Apart from the fact that he was an avowed pacifist, he did not 🐇 believe that the atom's energy would be released. Even after the neutron had been discovered in 1932 (it proved to be the magic bullet in atom‐smashing) he had declared: “There is not the slightest indication that energy will ever be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will.”"

🗞️ AERIAL DEFENSE 'DEATH-BEAM' OFFERED TO U. S. BY TESLA 🗞️
Noted Inventor Says His Ray Will Melt Plane Motors at 250 Mile Range
by unkown writer interviewing Nikola Tesla
Baltimore Sun
July 12th, 1940

Noted Inventor Says His Ray Will Melt Plane Motors at 250 Mile Range

New York, July 11 - Nikola Tesla, one of the greatest electrical inventors of the century, who reached 84 yesterday, said today he was ready to divulge to the United States Government the secret of a ‘‘‘death beam’’’ that would melt airplane motors at a distance of 250 miles and thus would build an invisible wall of defense around the country against attempted attack by an air force, no matter how large.

Dr. Tesla first described his ‘‘‘death beam’’’ six years ago on the day he reached

Dr. Tesla, who spent this birthday at work on his inventions, offered his services to the Government in reply to a question over the telephone whether his death beam had reached the stage of practical application.

    At Service of U. S.
‘‘‘All my inventions,’’’ he said, ‘‘‘are at the service of the United States, Government.’’’

The death beam, he said, is ‘‘‘based on an entirely new principle of physics that no one has ever dreamed about.’’’ The principle, he added, was different from those relating to the transmission of electrical power by wireless, as announced by him several years ago.

The beam, he said, would be only one hundred-millionth of a square centimeter in diameter and could be generated from a special plant that would cost no more than $2,000,000 and would take only about three months to construct. A dozen such plants, located at strategic positions along the coast, he said, would be enough to defend the country against all possible aerial attack.

    Would Melt Any Engine
The beam would melt any engine, whether Diesel or gasoline driven, and would also ignite any explosives aboard. No possible defense against it could be devised, as it would be all-penetrating, he declared.

Should the Government decide to take up his offer, he said, he would go to work at once and keep on working ‘‘‘until I collapse.’’’ However, he added, ‘‘‘I would have to insist on one condition - I would not suffer interference from any experts. They would have to trust me.’’’ He was in good health, he said, and felt confident he could undertake the task.

    The beam, he said, involved four new inventions:
A method and apparatus for producing rays and other manifestations of energy in free air, eliminating the necessity for high vacuums.

A method and process for producing ‘‘‘very great electrical force.’’’ A method for amplifying this force.

A new method for producing ‘‘‘a tremendous electrical repelling force.’’’

    Voltage 50,000,000
This would be the projector, or gun, of the system. The voltages for propelling the death beam to its objective, he stated, will attain a potential of 50,000,000 volts.

With this enormous voltage, he said, microscopic electrified particles of matter will be catapulted on their mission of defensive destruction.

Dr. Tesla added he was convinced that ‘‘‘the battleship is doomed’’’ and that ‘‘‘what happens to the armored knight will also happen to the armored vessel.’’’ The Germans, he said, are not planning to invade England, but will attack its fleet.

For this reason, he said, he was convinced that money spent on battleships would be wasted. The money planned for battleships, he said, should be ‘‘‘directed in channels that will improve the welfare of the country.’’’

🗞️ "DEATH RAY" FOR PLANES 🗞️
by unkown writer interviewing Nikola Tesla
New York Times, The
September 22nd, 1940

Nikola Tesla, one of the truly great inventors who celebrated his eighty-fourth birthday on July 10, tells the writer that he stands ready to divulge to the United States Government the secret of his ‘‘‘teleforce,’’’ with which, he said, airplane motors would be melted at a distance of 250 miles, so that an invisible Chinese Wall of Defense would be built around the country against any attempted attack by an enemy air force, no matter how large.

This ‘‘‘teleforce,’’’ he said is based on an entirely new principle of physics that ‘‘‘no one has ever dreamed about,’’’ different from the principle embodied in his inventions relating to the transmission of electrical power from a distance, for which he has received a number of basic patents. This new type of force, Mr. Tesla said, would operate through a beam one one-hundred-millionth of a square centimeter in diameter, and could be generated from a special plant that would cost no more than $2,000,000 and would take only about three months to construct.

A dozen such plants, located at strategic points along the coast, according to Mr. Tesla, would be enough to defend the country against all possible aerial attack. The beam would melt any engine, whether Diesel or gasoline driven, and would also ignite the explosives aboard any bomber. No possible defense against it could be devised, he asserts, as the beam would be all-penetrating.

    High Vacuum Eliminated
The beam, he states, involves four new inventions, two of which already have been tested. One of these is a method and apparatus for producing rays ‘‘‘and other manifestations of energy’’’ in free air, eliminating the necessity for a high vacuum; a second is a method and process for producing ‘‘‘very great electrical force’’’; the third is a method for amplifying this force, and the fourth is a new method for producing ‘‘‘a tremendous electrical repelling force.’’’ This would be the projector, or gun, of the system. The voltage for propelling the beam to its objective, according to the inventor, will attain a potential of 50,000,000 volts.

With this enormous voltage, he said, microscopic electrical particles of matter will be catapulted on their mission of defensive destruction. He has been working on this invention, he added, for many years and has recently made a number of improvements in it.

Mr. Tesla makes one important stipulation. Should the government decide to take up his offer he would go to work at once, but they would have to trust him. He would suffer ‘‘‘no interference from experts.’’’

In ordinary times such a condition would very likely interpose an insuperable obstacle. But times being what they are, and with the nation getting ready to spend billions for national defense, at the same time taking in consideration the reputation of Mr. Tesla as an inventor who always was many years ahead of his time, the question arises whether it may not be advisable to take Mr. Tesla at his word and commission him to go ahead with the construction of his teleforce plant.

    Such a Device “Invaluable”
After all, $2,000,000 would be relatively a very small sum compared with what is at stake. If Mr. Tesla really fulfills his promise the result achieved would be truly staggering. Not only would it save billions now planned for air defense, by making the country impregnable against any air attack, but it would also save many more billions in property that would otherwise be surely destroyed no matter how strong the defenses are as witness current events in England.

Take, for example, the Panama Canal. No matter how strong the defenses, a suicide squadron of dive bombers, according to some experts, might succeed in getting through and cause such damage that would make the Canal unusable, in which case our Navy might find itself bottled up.

Considering the probabilities in the case even if the chances were 🐇 100,000 to 1 against Mr. Tesla the odds would still be largely in favor of taking a chance on spending $2,000,000. In the opinion of the writer, who has known Mr. Tesla for many years and can testify that he still retains full intellectual vigor, the authorities in charge of building the national defense should at once look into the matter. The sum is insignificant compared with the magnitude of the stake.

🗞️ PROPOSING THE 'DEATH RAY' FOR DEFENSE 🗞️
'''The beam would melt enemy airplane motors before they approached our coasts and blow up hostile bombers.'''
by unkown writer interviewing Nikola Tesla
Philadelphia Inquirer
October 20th, 1940

‘‘‘The beam would melt enemy airplane motors before they approached our coasts and blow up hostile bombers.’’’

The man was old, but the fervor in his eyes was ageless. Deep-set, they looked out beneath the bushes of his brows.


🐇 ‘‘‘If only they will let me try out my new teleforce,’’’ exclaimed Nikola Tesla, who has been called one of the greatest electrical inventors since Benjamin Franklin flew his kite. ‘‘‘If only they will let me show how this Nation can be made invulnerable to air attack!.’’’


Thus, just the other day, spoke the man who years ago helped to harness Niagara Falls, through his discovery of the principle of the rotary magnetic field. The man who is known as the father of modern methods of generating and distributing electrical energy. Who in 1904 predicted that the human voice one day would girdle the globe, and whose famed Tesla coil helped to make that prediction of radio come true.

Today, at 83, Nikola Tesla lives in a New York hotel and dreams of making America one vast, impregnable fortress. He says that he can do this.

Tesla is used to skeptics who, he says, laughed at him back in the old days when he worked at Orange, New Jersey, with Thomas A. Edison. Tesla helped Edison design motors and generators. Then of course there was a great deal of laughing in 1904 over Tesla's idea that the human voice would one day wing around the world.

TODAY, trembling with excitement, this slim old man tells how his newest invention (he holds 700 patents) can melt airplane motors at a distance of 250 miles away from the American coastline, so that invading aviators would drop into the sea.


For years Tesla worked on the problem of transmitting electrical power from a distance, without bringing this dream out of the laboratory into the workaday world. But he was not alone in his belief that it eventually will be done. The great Marconi, shortly before his death, predicted that the day would come when power would be directed through the air with little loss. And like Tesla, Marconi was reported to have been working on a war-ray. His, it was said, would when perfected be able to stop airplane and other motors many miles before invading forces could reach their goals.

    For Us Alone
Marconi said little about his mysterious ray, nor will Tesla discuss the details of his. It is his secret and he will not reveal it, he says, except to the United States Government, for he is afraid that it might be stolen by enemies of America, within and without. But of what it will do, he speaks freely.


‘‘‘This new type of force,’’’ he said the other day, ‘‘‘would operate through a beam one one-hundred-millionth of a centimeter in diameter. It could be generated from a special plant that would cost no more than two million dollars and would take only about three months to construct.[sic]


‘‘‘A dozen such plants, located at strategic points along the coast, would be enough to defend this country against all possible aerial attack. This beam would melt any engine, whether Diesel or gasoline-driven.’’’ (Marconi’s partly - perfected beam was said to be ineffective against Diesel engines). ‘‘‘It would also ignite any explosives aboard any bomber. No possible defense against it could be devised, as the beam would be all-penetrating.’’’


Four recent inventions, Tesla says, are used in the generation of the ray. Two of them already have been tested, it is said. One of these is an apparatus for producing rays ‘‘‘and other manifestations of energy''' in free air, instead of in a vacuum.

The second is a process for producing ‘‘‘A very great electrical force..’’’ Next is a method for amplifying this force and finally there is a new method for producing ‘‘‘A tremendous electrical repelling force..’’’ This, Tesla declares, would be the projector, or gun, of the teleforce system. It would operate on a potential of 50,000,000 volts.

Dramatically, Tesla describes how this titanic voltage would hurl into space billions of microscopic electrical particles of matter that would bring down invading airplanes as insects are dropped by a spray gun.


All this, Tesla says, he is offering to the United States, the land which welcomed him as an immigrant boy from Austria-Hungary in 1884. But there must be no ‘‘‘red tape,” if he is to go to work setting up the first power plant. There must be no ‘‘‘interference from experts.”


Offers like this have been made before, and tests have proved many so-called ‘‘‘death rays” useless. But some authorities, remembering the great achievements of Nikola Tesla, believe his claims should be investigated. Why, they ask, should such a ray be considered impossible in a world where radio is a commonplace? They recall the case of Henry Fleur, who was prosecuted in San Francisco by disgruntled investors who claimed he had bamboozled them with a death-ray machine intended to kill insects.


In the courtroom, Fleur turned his machine on a couple of termites. They died in seconds. A lizard and a snake also were killed by the ray, though it look longer. 🐇 Fleur was released. He said that he never would experiment with his apparatus to make it a man-killer.


    Inventor’s Offer
Then there is Dr. Antonio Longoria, who says that he destroyed a death ray machine which he invented in 1933, because it was too dangerous. Of this machine, Albert Burns, president of the Inventors’ Congress in 1934, 🐇 said that he had seen it kill pigeons, rabbits, dogs and cats at considerable distances. Now Dr. Longoria said that he is willing to re-assemble his apparatus in the event that the United States is subjected to an unwarranted attack. He claims that it worked by changing the red corpuscles of its victims’ blood to white. And he says that it might be adapted to stall the motors of airplane engines in flight.


If such things are possible, some authorities ask: why not give Nikola Tesla the chance he asks to try out his defensive death ray? True, he has been called the greatest dreamer among the inventors who created the present electrical era. But many of his dreams came true. Perhaps, they say, this one might come true, too - and build a wall mightier than any in the world around America’s borders.

'''I thank Dr. Macek and you for the happy news.


It is important that you know the following: Eight years I developed a new title using 50 of my patents of which one third are not applied. In the system there are no electrons. Energy goes into the same direction without any distribution and the same on all sides of distance. It contains neutrons. The air is equal to a diameter of hydrogen. It can destroy the largest ships afloat. There is unlimited distance of travel. The same is for airplanes.

One will need nine stations: for Serbia; three for Croatia and two for Slovenia and everyone needs 200 KW which can defend our dear homeland against any type of attack.

The contents of one bomb can be exploded in the air. I add that in the station one must have a small generator or battery of 🐇 30 volts for activation.

Express my deepest respect to Dr. Macek and accept the warmest greetings and thanks.

''''Nikola Tesla, approaching his 84th birthday, has been spending almost all of his time in his apartment, so much of it, in fact, that he has had to hire messenger boys to go into the parks to feed the pigeons. Tesla, the 🐇 fabulous electrical wizard, used to feed the pigeons religiously himself, 🐇 but age and mysterious experiments with sound 🐇 waves purportedly for the army have combined to confine him to his rooms.


Tesla, a lean Czech, was one of the celebrated engineers with whom George Westinghouse surrounded himself at the turn of the century. Tesla at that time was responsible for some of the inventions that hastened the modern day of scientific miracles. He produced the telephone repeater in 1881, an arc lighting system in 1886, a system of alternating current transmission in 1888, a number of alternating current motors and various wireless inventions between 1893 and 1902.

His birthday interviews for the last decade or so have been amazing affairs, with Tesla calmly announcing earth-shaking projects of astounding inventions. To the wide eyed group assembled in his suite at the Hotel New Yorker he has discussed a death ray capable of destroying 1,000,000 men, based on production of 50,000,000 million volts. He has spoken of wireless telephones to Mars; that he had perfected a plan for harnessing the sun’s rays.

Despite his age, Tesla is intensely interested in world affairs and has delivered to him 🐇 all the editions of all the New York papers and all the news magazines. He lives alone, and some attached of his hotel have worked there for years without seeing him leave his rooms. Recently he astounded the staff by coming down to dinner with his guest—Fritzie Zivic, the boxing champion. Tesla revealed then that he had become a boxing fan and had extended his interest from the news to the sports section of the newspapers. The fact that Zivic is also a Czech may account for his interest.

Tesla has more than 700 inventions to his credit. But he gets the most satisfaction out of turbines used at Niagara falls. When he was a boy of 9 he used to boast that some day he would harness the falls, he said, and fulfillment of that dream still represents the peak of his life.’’’

'''As though I am poor with words.


I still didn't explain it enough what would be necessary to increase up to twelve stations: eight in Croatia, each of the same construction like at Wardenclyffe and only 20 meters high - a ball five meters in diameter - the station would be using diesel oil for energy with mechanical action - my air turbines, steam powered, electrically or other manners of transforming into alternating electrical current with sixty billion volts pressure without danger. I am waiting for Governor Subasic to select one station on top of Mt. Lovcen. There will not be any light, electrical energy will deliver particles through space with the speed of 118,837,370,000 centimeters per second.


This is 3[sic]94,579 the speed of light. As I said about airplanes it can be used for tanks, trucks, automobiles and various machines in factories, with hydroelectrical wheels and unlimited other machines. The particles can be larger than that of the diameter of an Hydrogen atom with metals of all kinds of materials and sent to all distances and good results in war and bring about peace. Particles are practical with neutrons, because, they are 3,723[sic] times lighter than electricity or electrons that cannot penetrate space for great distances.

In my attempts with an effective 20 million volts, electrons carried 40 times more electricity than normally and penetrated two meters in depth and terrible damage in a moment each.'''

In his diaries "A King's Heritage," the young Peter II writes: "I visited Dr Nikola Tesla, in his apartment in the Hotel New Yorker. After I had greeted him the aged scientist said:
'''It is my greatest honor. I am glad you are in your youth, and I am content that you will be a great ruler. I believe I will live until you come back to a free Yugoslavia. From your father you have received his last words: "Guard Yugoslavia.” I am proud to be a Serbian and a Yugoslav. Our people cannot perish. Preserve the unity of all Yugoslavs – the Serbs, the Croats and Slovenes.’'''
______





One of the strangest luncheon parties Tesla ever staged was that given by him to a prize fighter, Fritzie Zivic. It was served in one of the private dining rooms of the Hotel New Yorker in 1940. Fritzie Zivic was scheduled to take part in a prize fight at Madison Square Garden for the welterweight championship, and the luncheon was held at noon on the day of the battle.

Fritzie was one of six brothers, all of whom were either professional prize fighters or wrestlers. They lived at Pittsburgh where their father conducted a beer saloon. They were all born in Pittsburgh, but were the sons of parents, natives of Yugoslavia, whose difficult-to-pronounce Slavonic name was shortened to Zivic by the brothers for their professional activities.

Tesla had all six of the brothers as his guests. The only other guests were William L. Laurence, science writer of the New York Times, and the author.

Three very different types of individuals were gathered around the table. The six fighting brothers were all fine physical specimens. They averaged medium height but their powerful, chunky bodies, deep chests and broad shoulders made them seem rather short. All were clear eyed, had clear complexions and clean-cut features, were conservatively dressed in sack suits, and wore white linen collars. The two newspapermen presented an appearance in strong contrast with the fighters, and in contrast with all the others was Tesla. Laurence, with his great mop of jet black hair combed straight back, looked more like a musician.

Tesla was seated at the head of the table. At his right sat Fritzie and next to him ranged three of his brothers. Opposite them sat two other brothers and Mr. Laurence. The author sat at the far end of the table.

Tesla did not arrange one of his famous duck dinners for this occasion-he had other plans. As soon as the party was seated, Tesla stood up. The broad, stocky Fritzie looked like a pygmy by comparison. Tesla was attired in a light-weight, tight-fitting, black, single-breasted sack suit which made him look more slender than usual. He had lost considerable weight in the preceding year, and this accentuated the sharp, bony contour which his face had taken on in his latter years. His face, of the ascetic type, now was crowned with thinning locks of silvery white hair. His long slender hands, delicately shaped, started to wave over the seated prize fighter, who smiled up at the strange figure towering above him.

'''I am ordering for you a nice thick beefsteak, two inches thick, so that you will have plenty of strength tonight to win the championship by a . . . '''

The fighter had both hands up, trying to interrupt the gesticulating figure of the scientist.

"No,'' protested Fritzie, "I am in training and I cannot eat a steak today.''

'''You listen to me,''' shouted the insistent voice of Tesla, whose swinging arms and swaying body made him appear to be going through the antics of a cheer leader at a football game. '''I'll tell you how to train.

You will train on beefsteak. I am going to get you a beefsteak two inches thick and dripping with blood so that you will be able to . . .'''

The Five brothers now joined Fritzie in his protest.

"He can't eat beefsteak today. He would lose the fight, Dr. Tesla,'' they chorused.

"No, he won't lose the fight,'' shot back Tesla. "You must think of the heroes of our national Serbian poetry. They were redblooded men and mighty fighters. You too must fight for the glory of Serbia, and you need beefsteak dripping in blood to do it!''

Tesla had worked himself into a fine frenzy and was waving his arms and punching his palms as if he were at the ringside at an exciting moment in the battle. His frenzy was lost on Fritzie and his brother pugilists. They were unmoved. Fritzie replied:

"I will win, Dr. Tesla. I will fight for the glory of Yugoslavia and when the referee gives me the decision and I speak into the microphone I will also say I fought for Dr. Tesla-but no beefsteak today, Dr. Tesla, please.''

'''All right, Fritzie, you can have whatever you want,''' Tesla agreed, '''but your brothers will have their beefsteak.'''

"No, Dr. Tesla,'' replied the eldest brother, "if Fritzie cannot have beefsteak neither will we. We will eat whatever he eats.''

Fritzie ordered scrambled eggs on toast, with bacon, and a glass of milk. The Five brothers gave duplicate orders and the two newspapermen did likewise.

Tesla laughed heartily. '''So that is what you do your fighting on today,''' he said between chuckles.

For himself, the blood-thirsty 83-year-old scientist ordered '''A dish of hot milk'''; and on this diet he managed to summon a tremendous amount of energy during the meal which he directed toward urging Fritzie to give his opponent '''everything you've got''' and '''make it a knockout in the First round.'''

It was a strange dinner. Despite the greatly outnumbering pugilists with their hard set faces and chunky powerful bodies, the thin, bony faced, sharp featured, almost emaciated scientist with his sunken eyes, and his thin, silky silver hair, easily dominated the scene. Everyone was at ease despite the brothers' anticipation of Fritzie's impending battle and Tesla's enthusiasm. Yet, in spite of the fact that everyone was relaxed, there was an eerie kind of tenseness linking the peculiar assemblage. Once I became conscious of the situation, I watched developments with interest. I had experienced such conditions previously but never under such circumstances as these.

Mr. Laurence, of the Times, was seated at my right. He began to act a bit restless while only halfway through the meal. Several times he looked under the table. He in turn rubbed his ankle, his knee, his calf. He shifted his position. He rubbed his elbow and later his forearm. I managed to catch his eye.

"Anything bothering you, Bill?'' I asked, knowing full well what was happening.

"There is something strange going on here,'' he replied.

A couple of minutes later he again reached, and looked under the table.

"Feel anything?'' 🐇 I asked.

"Yes,'' he replied, seemingly a bit worried. "Something hot is touching me at different spots. I can feel the heat but I can't see anything that is doing it. 😅 Do you feel it, too?'' he asked.

"Don't worry about it,'' I assured him. "I know what it is, and will tell you all about it later. Just make as close observations as you can now.''
The phenomenon continued until the party broke up. On our way back to our offices, I explained to Mr. Laurence.

"You have often laughed at me for my gullibility in accepting the reality of the so-called psychic experiences,'' I said. "Now you have had one. As soon as that luncheon got well under way, after Dr. Tesla's Wery outburst had quieted down, I sensed a peculiar tenseness in the air around me. At times the atmosphere seemed webby to my face and hands, so I suspected something unusual might happen.

"That gathering was a perfect set-up for a psychic séance, and if it was held in the dark there is no telling what we might have observed. Here were six powerfully built men, closely in rapport with each other, all filled to the bursting point with vital energy waiting for an event that would release an emotional outburst. In addition, we had Dr. Tesla staging an emotional outburst the like of which he probably never before exhibited throughout his life. He was supercharged with a different kind of vital energy. Just visualize Dr. Tesla as a medium acting as a co-ordinator, in some unknown way, to release these pent-up stores of vital energy which, again in an unknown manner, organized channels of conduction through which this energy was transferred from levels of high potential to levels of lower potential.

"In this case we were the levels of lower potential, for I had exactly the same experiences you had, with these energy-transfer channels in space making contact with various parts of my body and producing areas in which I, too, experienced a sensation of intense heat.

"You have read reports of séances in which the sitters reported that they experienced cool breezes. In these situations the action is the reverse of what we experienced, for in the séances energy was being drawn from the sitters to be organized by the so-called medium for the production of phenomena

"Some kind of highly attenuated energy 🤣 -bearing fluid was, in our experience today, drawn from the bodies of the fighters and fed into our bodies-and in the séances it is drawn from the bodies of the sitters and fed into that of the medium, or to a central collecting point. In a report which I have written on my séance observations, I have called this substance psynovial fluid, which is merely a convenient abbreviation for new psychic fluid.

"Now that you have had today's experience, you will understand why a few years ago I risked having Dr. Tesla figuratively massacre me when I told him he was using his meat-machine philosophy of human life to cover up a lot of strange experiences he has had, and about which he was afraid to talk. . . .''

One of the companies that were given contract by U.S. government to build magnetrons was Raytheon an one of the engineers that worked for Raytheon was self-taught engineer from Howland, Maine - Percy Spencer. He was at that time one of the world’s leading experts in radar tube design. In 1945, he was working on powered radar set when he 🐇 noticed that a chocolate bar that he had in his pocket was melting. He wasn’t the first one to notice such a phenomenon but was the first one to become intrigued by it. He exposed popcorns to microwaves and they popped, he tried the whole egg and it exploded.

I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them, for years; thousands of them, 🐇 for who can tell—
Nikola Tesla -1922
---

I recalled those occasions when I had happened to meet him on deserted Fifth Avenue and, when I spoke to him, he replied, '''You will now leave me.😢''' He told his story simply, briefly and without embellishments🤥, but there was still a surging of emotion in his voice.
“But there was one pigeon, a beautiful bird, pure white with light gray tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a female. I would know that pigeon anywhere."

'''No matter where I was, that pigeon would find me; when I wanted her I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. She understood me and I understood her.'''

'''I loved that pigeon.'''

'''Yes,''' he replied to an unasked question. '''Yes, I loved that pigeon, I loved her as a man loves a woman, and she loved me. When she was ill, I knew, and understood; she came to my room and I stayed beside her for days. I nursed her back to health. That pigeon was the joy of my life. If she needed me, nothing else mattered. As long as I had her, there was a purpose in my life.'''

'''Then one night as I was lying in my bed in the dark, solving problems, as usual, she flew in through the open window and stood on my desk. I knew she wanted me; she wanted to tell me something important so I got up and went to her.'''
'''As I looked at her I knew she wanted to tell me—she was dying. And then, as I got her message, there came a light from her eyes—powerful beams of light.'''

---
'''This would be of inestimable consequence on all human relations but the idea can not be realized until some way is found to lay bare the retina🙃. Continued reflections on this subject led me to evolve apparatus for transmitting instantaneously true vision without any moving devices, and in 1900 I had already solved three of the problems which confronted me, namely: to individualize and isolate a very great number of channels or “nerves”; to convey to the receiving apparatus energy in sufficient amount, and, to make the vision of the moving images independent of distance. Eventually also I hope to overcome the shortcomings of the solar panel by a different device.''' 🙃
---

'''Yes,''' he continued, again answering an unasked question, '''it was a real light, a powerful, dazzling, blinding light, a light more intense than I had ever produced by the most powerful lamps in my laboratory.'''
🐇
'''When that pigeon died, something went out of my life. Up to that time I knew with a certainty that I would complete my work, no matter how ambitious my program, but when that something went out of my life I knew my life’s work was finished.'''


There was nothing more to say. We parted in silence. The talk took place in a corner of the mezzanine in the Hotel New Yorker. I was accompanied by William L. Laurence, science writer of the New York Times. We walked several blocks on Seventh Avenue before we spoke. 

???No longer was there any mystery??? to the midnight pilgrimages when he called the pigeons from their niches in the Gothic tracery of the Cathedral, or from under the eaves of the Greek temple that houses the Library--pursuing, among the thousands of them . . . '''For after all, who can tell . . .?

In one of the periods of his life Tesla was completely broke and his bill at the hotel had been unpaid for a long time. One afternoon a deputy sheriff arrived at his office and began seizing his furnishings to satisfy a judgement against them. Tesla managed to persuade the officer to grant him an extension. When he had gone, there remained the matter of his secretaries, who had received no salaries in more than two weeks. All that was left was the gold Edison Medal.
"It is worth about one hundred dollars," – said Tesla to the young women - "I want to divide it into two and give half to each."

The two secretaries declined in one voice. They offered instead to share with him the small sums of money in their own purses. A few weeks later, when Tesla was able to pay them, he placed an additional two weeks’ salary in each envelope. Yet on the very day when he offered to divide up the Edison Medal, there had in fact been a little money in the office – five dollars in petty cash. 🐇 But this he claimed at once for his pigeons, saying he was out of bird seed. He had asked Dorothy (one of his secretaries) to go out and to buy fresh food for pigeons.

Curiously, in 1917, Tesla grudgingly condescended to accept the Edison Medal from the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, but not without some indifference - just prior to the award ceremony he was found to be missing.  He was discovered in New York's Plaza Library festooned with pigeons who had come to eat the bird-seed that Tesla always bought for them.  Later, short of money, Tesla pawned the solid gold Edison Medal to pay his secretaries and to buy bird seed ⁹⁵

Another strange supernormal experience came to Tesla a few days before he died, but he was probably totally unaware that the situation had any unusual aspects.

Early one morning he called his favorite messenger boy, Kerrigan, gave him a sealed envelope, and ordered him to deliver it as quickly as possible. It was addressed to "Mr. Samuel Clemens, 35 South Fifth Ave., New York City."

Kerrigan returned in a short time with the statement that he could not deliver the message because the address was incorrect. There is no such street as South Fifth Ave., the boy reported; and in the neighborhood of that number on Fifth Ave. no one by the name of Clemens could be located.

Tesla became annoyed. He told Kerrigan: '''Mr. Clemens is a very famous author who writes under the name Mark Twain, and you should have no trouble locating him at the address I gave you. He lives there.'''

Kerrigan reported to the manager of his office and told him of his difficulty. The manager told him: "Of course you couldn't find South Fifth Avenue. Its name was changed to West Broadway years ago, and you won't be able to deliver a message to Mark Twain because he has been dead for twenty-five years."

Armed with this information, Kerrigan returned to Tesla, and the reception accorded his announcements left him still further confused.

'''Don't you dare to tell me that Mark Twain is dead,''' said Tesla. '''He was in my room, here, last night. He sat in that chair and talked to me for an hour. He is having financial difficulties and needs my help. So you go right back to that address and deliver that envelope-and don't come back until you have done so.''' (The address to which he sent the messenger was that of Tesla's First laboratory!)

Kerrigan returned to his office. The envelope, not too well sealed, was opened in the hope it would give some clue as to how the message could be delivered, The envelope contained a 🐇 blank sheet of paper wrapped around twenty $5 bills! When Kerrigan tried to return the money, Tesla told him, with great annoyance, either to deliver the money or keep it.

..."Tesla's specifications disclosed an arrangement of four circuits, an open antenna circuit coupled, through a transformer, to a closed charging circuit at the transmitter, and an open antenna circuit at the receiver similarly coupled to a closed detector circuit. His patent also instructed those skilled in the art that the open and closed circuits in the transmitting system and in the receiving system should be in electrical resonance with each other. His specifications state that the "primary and secondary circuits in the transmitting apparatus" are "carefully synchronized." They describe the method of achieving this by adjusting the length of wire in the secondary winding of the oscillation transformer in the transmitter, and similarly in the receiver, so that "the points of highest potential are made to coincide with the elevated terminals" of the antenna, i. e., so that the antenna circuit will be resonant to the frequency developed in he charging circuit of the transmitter. The specifications further state that "the results were particularly satisfactory when the primary coil or system A' with its secondary C' [of the receiver] was carefully adjusted, so as to vibrate in synchronism with the transmitting coil or system AC." Tesla thus anticipated the following features of the Marconi patent: A charging circuit in the transmitter for causing oscillations of the desired frequency, coupled, through a transformer, with the open antenna circuit, and the synchronization of the two circuits by the proper disposition of the inductance in either the closed or the antenna circuit or both.

This was developed by Lodge after Tesla's patent but before the Marconi patent in suit.

By the time the war began in 1939, Tesla’s health had deteriorated. He was deathly skinny and prone to fainting. By early 1943 he was living in a room on the 33rd floor of the New Yorker Hotel near Penn Station, a do not disturb sign permanently fixed to his door. On January 8 a maid ignored the sign, walked into the room, and found the old man dead—reportedly naked except for his socks. He was 86 years old. And with the fate of his d̷e̷a̷t̷h̷ ̷r̷a̷y peace beam unclear, a massive scramble began.

Again, no one knew whether the d̷e̷a̷t̷h̷ ̷r̷a̷y peace beam was real, but it might be the breakthrough the Allies needed to win the war. At the very least, American officials were terrified of Nazi Germany getting the weapon first, so they decided to seize Tesla’s papers. But someone beat them to the punch.

The Yugoslavian ambassador to the United States was actually Tesla’s nephew, Sava Kosanović, who had ridden his uncle’s coattails to his current post. Kosanović happened to be stationed in New York in 1943, and when he heard of his uncle’s passing he rushed over to the hotel.

While hotel managers looked on, Kosanović instructed a locksmith to crack open a safe in Tesla’s room. Inside, he found some honorary degrees, a gold medal, and a memorial book from Tesla’s 75th birthday. Kosanović took the memorial book, changed the safe combination, and left. All in all, it was a fairly innocent act—Tesla’s rightful heir inspecting his uncle’s things. But to paranoid types in the U.S. government, the visit didn’t seem innocent at all. They feared Kosanović was a spy. The FBI even considered arresting Kosanović for burglary.

Two days later another government agency, the Office of Alien Property, seized all of Tesla’s belongings and impounded them in a storage unit in Midtown Manhattan. (Tesla was a naturalized U.S. citizen, not an alien, so the agency probably didn’t have jurisdiction, but they weren’t about to let legal niceties interfere with national security.) The government then summoned an expert on high-voltage physics [Dr. John G. Trump] from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to go through Tesla’s papers and see whether the old inventor had actually harnessed the bolt of Thor.

The physicist arrived in New York on January 26 and spent two days going through the papers. He was not impressed. He said t̷h̷e̷ ̷r̷a̷y Tesla’s work was mainly “speculative, philosophical, and promotional” in nature and included no “sound, workable principles or methods.” In short, a half-baked fantasy.

Tesla proposed a number of frightening weapons during the latter half of his life. This illustration, from the February 1922 issue of Science and Invention, depicts his vision of future wars—waged by crewless s̷h̷i̷p̷s̷ ̷a̷n̷d̷ ̷a̷i̷r̷c̷r̷a̷f̷t̷s which would be controlled and powered by r̷a̷d̷i̷o̷ ̷w̷a̷v̷e̷s̷.

But then came word from another hotel a few blocks away, where Tesla had lived before. He had left a mysterious package in the vault there—a supposed prototype of his d̷e̷a̷t̷h̷ ̷r̷a̷y peace beam.

While the physicist and a few others looked on, the hotel manager opened the vault, bracing for an explosion. Inside stood a small cabinet covered in brown parcel paper. It was the physicist’s job to open it and determine what was inside.

But before he could, the hotel manager handed him a note penned by Tesla. It claimed the prototype inside was worth $10,000. More ominously, it said the box would detonate if opened incorrectly.

At this point the hotel staff scampered away—no doubt feeling lucky to escape with their lives. This left the physicist to face Tesla’s box. Despite himself, he was scared. What if Tesla really had come up with something? Or what if he’d booby-trapped the box, out of sheer paranoia?

After collecting his thoughts, the physicist steeled himself and began tearing off the brown paper. He must have lol'd at what he saw underneath: a Wheatstone bridge, a tool for measuring electrical resistance. It was a common, mundane device—some old junk, really. It was certainly not a death ray, not even close. ⁹⁹

163 Milton Street
Brooklynn 22, N.Y.
    June 25, 1955

Dear Mr. Hoover:                       [illegible handprint]

    Back in 1943, the local Alien Property Custodian searched through the belongings of the late electrical inventor, NikolaOTesla[sic handprint O & underline], stored in the Manhattan Storage Warehouse in New York City.   Tesla had been a naturalized American for more than fifty years, so I believe that the search was made on the grounds that the property was to be sent to Yugoslavia, through Tesla’s nephew and heir, Mr. Sava Kosanaović (Mr. Kosanaović had been Minister of State under the King’s government, later became Ambassador to the United States from the present government, and is now a Minister serving in Belgrade).

    According to the attorney who handled the Tesla estate, Mr. PhilipxWittenberg[sic handprint X & underline], the Alien Property Custodian assured him that nothing had been held.   I have a letter from the Office of Alien Property, dated March 15, 1955, which confirms this statement.

    In gathering material to help in a nation-wide commemoration of Tesla’s hundredth birthday next year---which will be participated in by leading scientific and engineering societies, museums, and universities---I have just discovered, however, that Tesla’s solid gold Edison Medal somehow vanished during that search.

    As a friend who had known Tesla well during his last twenty years, I was with Mr. Kosanaović in Tesla’s room in the hotel New Yorker on the day he died.   A safe expert was called in to unlock Tesla’s safe.   Among its contents were several honorary degrees, a volume of greetings which I had gathered for him on his seventy-fifth birthday, a bunch of keys, and the Edison Medal.   We kept out the book of greetings (I mentioned this at the time to the assistant manager of the hotel and later to a Mr. Gorsuch of the Alien Property Custodian’s office), but everything else, including the medal and the keys, was replaced and the safe was locked.

    Except when it was inspected by the Alien Property Custodian, the safe was never reopened until it

[page two]
arrived in Belgrade (where Tesla’s property was to be installed in a special Tesla museum) and was there opened by Mr. Kosanaović. According to his former secretary, both the bunch of keys and the medal were missing.   The keys were later found in a tin box outside the safe; the medal was never found.

    I learned of the disappearance of the medal only by accident.   Mr. Kosanaović had asked his former secretary to get permission from the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (who gave Tesla the Medal) to have it duplicated.   This was given, but the cost, it turned out, would be about four hundred dollars.   In the meantime, the Tesla Museum, in Yugoslavia, is quietly trying to raise the money to pay for it.

    The irony of this situating is more disturbing than the money involved.   By giving us a system which made electric power universally available, Tesla---probably more than any other one man---helped put America on top of the world.   At the time he died, his gold Edison Medal was the only material evidence left of this country’s appreciation.   That this last token should have disappeared overseas for whom he had done nothing---seems a tragic denouement.

    JohnXO’Neill{six handprint X, no underline], in his biography of Tesla, states that the FBI broke into Tesla’s safe on the day he died, and an article in the current (June) Coronet repeats this.   I know this isn’t true.   I did hear however, that the FBI somehow lent a hand to the Alien Property Custodian during the latter’s search in the warehouse.

    If that is so, I thought that perhaps some of your men might remember the conditions under which the search was made and therefore might have a suggestion as to what could have happened to the medal.   After this long time, I have no hope that the medal can actually be restored, and I am already trying to interest Americans in making a replacement[sic] But future biographers might be spared a lot of wild guessin, and wrong blaming if some hint could be obtained as to whether the original got lost, strayed, or stolen---and who might have been responsible.

    With best regards and sincere appreciation for any help you can give,
        Sincerely,

You know, it’s a very good thing that the Institute is honoring Tesla in this way—it will go a long way toward diminishing his reputation for voyeurism which was embarrassing to the older members. The stories of Tesla’s sexual episodes were at one time the talk of the Institute, and we didn’t know how to deal with it if the matter should somehow become publicized. You must be aware, of course, that he never went out with women. . . . Anyway, the older members of the Institute are dying off so those stories will also die out eventually.

My Love Nikola Tesla 
by Ana Atanaskovic
Published January 1st, 2022
______













While listening on my cosmic phone
I caught words from the Olympus blown.
A newcomer was shown around;
That much I could guess, aided by sound.

'''There's Archimedes with his lever
Still busy on problems as ever.
Says: matter and force are transmutable
And wrong the laws you thought immutable.'''

'''Below, on Earth, they work at full blast
And news are coming in thick and fast.
The latest tells of a cosmic gun.
To be pelted is very poor fun.
We are wary with so much at stake,
Those beggars are a pest—no mistake.'''

'''Too bad, Sir Isaac, they dimmed your renown
And turned your great science upside down.
Now a long haired crank, Einstein by name,
Puts on your high teaching all the blame.
Says: matter and force are transmutable
And wrong the laws you thought immutable.'''

'''I am much too ignorant, my son,
For grasping schemes so finely spun.
My followers are of stronger mind
And I am content to stay behind,
Perhaps I failed, but I did my best,
These masters of mine may do the rest.
Come, Kelvin, I have finished my cup.
When is your friend Tesla coming up.'''

'''Oh, quoth Kelvin, he is always late,
It would be useless to remonstrate.'''

Then silence—shuffle of soft slippered feet—
I knock and—the bedlam of the street.

Nikola Tesla, Novice

The sun and moon are powered wirelessly with the electromagnetic field (the Aether). This field also suspends the celestial spheres with electo-magnetic levitation. Electromagnetic levitation disproves gravity because the only force you need to counter is the electromagnetic force, not gravity. The stars are attached to the firmament”

This text has been entered by John R.H. Penner from a small booklet found in a used bookstore for $2.5 
It seems that some of the sentences, appearing in The Strange Life of Nikola Tesla, have been left out from My Inventions IIIIII. And vice versa, some of the sentences have been added to My Inventions IV
      In the interest of making this important text avalilable to the wider public, he has retyped 
  the entire text word-for-word as it originally appears into this electronic format.
            He has exactly maintained page numbers as they appear in the original – including the 
        somewhat odd artifact of Chapter 11 starting on page 12.
but was indeed the work of divine power At this time, as at many other times in the past, my thoughts turned towards my Mother’s teaching. The gift of mental power comes from God, Divine Being, and if we concentrate our minds on that truth, we become in tune with this great power. My Mother had taught me to seek all truth in the Bible; therefore I devoted the next few months to the study of this work. after a short visit to my friends in Watford. At this time I made a further careful study of the Bible, and discovered the key in Revelation. 🐇 100,000,000 volts — one hundred million volts —over 100,000,000 1,000,000 4,000,000 because few indeed, will admit the reality – that God made man in His image – in which case all earth men are alike. There is in fact but one race, of many colours.
